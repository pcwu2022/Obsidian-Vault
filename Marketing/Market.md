Understanding different types of markets is crucial for startups and businesses to determine their strategy, positioning, and risk management. Markets can be categorized into four main types: **Existing Market**, **Resegmented Market**, **New Market**, and **Clone Market**. Each type has unique characteristics in terms of customers, needs, product performance, competition, and risk.

## 1. Existing Market

- **Customers**: Already exist and are familiar with current solutions.
    
- **Customer Needs**: Focused on product performance—customers want better, faster, or more efficient solutions.
    
- **Product Performance**: Innovations are incremental; products must outperform competitors (e.g., better features, speed, quality).
    
- **Competition**: Dominated by current market leaders with high market share.
    
- **Risk**: High, as you directly compete with established players.
    

**Example**: Competing with top smartphone brands by offering a more powerful device.

## 2. Resegmented Market

This type of market can be divided into two subtypes: **Low-Cost Market** and **Niche Market**.

- **Customers**: A mix of existing customers dissatisfied with current options and new customers with specific needs.
    
- **Customer Needs**:
    
    - **Low-Cost Market**: Reduce cost for price-sensitive customers.
        
    - **Niche Market**: Solve a problem or meet a specific need that mainstream products ignore.
        
- **Product Performance**:
    
    - **Low-Cost**: Simplified or stripped-down products (e.g., Xiaomi's affordable smartphones).
        
    - **Niche**: Tailored features for a narrow segment (e.g., IPC systems for industrial users).
        
- **Competition**: Still face existing market leaders but with a different angle.
    
- **Risk**:
    
    - Incumbent retaliation.
        
    - Failure of the niche or low-cost strategy to scale.
        

**Example**: Introducing a budget-friendly alternative or a specialized B2B solution.

## 3. New Market

- **Customers**: Do not currently exist in this market category; typically non-consumers.
    
- **Customer Needs**: Simplicity and convenience—customers may not realize they had a need until educated.
    
- **Product Performance**: Designed for untapped or underserved customers. Products must be intuitive and low-friction. Market education is essential.
    
- **Competition**: No direct competitors initially, but face indirect competition from alternative behaviors or habits.
    
- **Risk**: High risk due to market adoption uncertainty—will the market understand or accept the solution?
    

**Example**: The sharing economy (e.g., Airbnb, Uber in their early days).

## 4. Clone Market

- **Customers**: Do not currently exist in the local region, but exist in other countries.
    
- **Customer Needs**: Similar to those in a foreign market; proven needs and behaviors.
    
- **Product Performance**: A local adaptation of a successful idea from abroad; must be localized for culture, regulations, and usage patterns.
    
- **Competition**: Generally no local competitors; the original foreign company may not have entered the market yet.
    
- **Risk**: Cultural adoption is the main challenge—will the product fit local norms and behaviors?
    

**Example**: Launching a local version of Uber in a country before Uber enters.
