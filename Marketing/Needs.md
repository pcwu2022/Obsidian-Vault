## Types of Needs

### 1. Basic (Functional) Needs
These are practical, utilitarian problems that [[Customer|customers]] face and expect solutions for.

- Example ([[Startup]]): A ride-hailing app like [[Uber]] solves the need for reliable and fast transportation.
- Example (Product): Dropbox addresses the need for file storage and access across devices.

### 2. Emotional Needs
These relate to how a person feels. Solving emotional needs creates deeper loyalty and engagement.

- Example ([[Marketing]]): [[Apple]]'s marketing taps into the emotional need for identity, status, and [[creativity]].
- Example (Product): Headspace addresses the emotional need for calm, clarity, and stress reduction.

### 3. Social Needs
These are needs tied to connection, belonging, recognition, or [[influence]].

- Example (Startup): Instagram initially served the need for social expression and peer validation.
- Example (Marketing): Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign inspires individuals to belong to a community of achievers.

### 4. Latent Needs
Needs that customers are not fully aware of yet. Innovation often comes from identifying and solving these.

- Example (Startup): [[Airbnb]] uncovered the latent need for affordable, local, and flexible lodging options.
- Example (Product): Tesla redefined the driving experience by meeting the latent need for eco-luxury.

### 5. Aspirational Needs
These reflect desires about who a person wants to become or how they want to be perceived.

- Example (Marketing): Lululemon connects to aspirational needs around health, mindfulness, and lifestyle.
- Example (Product): Duolingo meets the need for self-improvement and global connectedness.

| Want | A specific way to satisfy a need                                            | Own a luxury car             |
| Demand | A want backed by ability and willingness to pay                           | Buy a Tesla                  |

## Needs Identification in Startups

1. Observation and Interviews: Understanding user behavior and struggles (e.g., [[pain point]] discovery)
2. Problem Validation: Asking “Is this a real need?” “Is it painful enough to pay for?”
3. User [[Persona]] Creation: Mapping needs to motivations and lifestyles
4. [[JTBD]] (Jobs to be Done): Framing the need as a “job” the user is hiring your product to do

## Frameworks for Identifying Needs

### [[Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs]]
- Physiological
- Safety

- Esteem
- Self-Actualization

> Used to understand where your product fits in users' lives.

### [[Value Proposition|Value Proposition Canvas]]
- Map customer pains, gains, and jobs-to-be-done against your solution.

### Problem-Solution Fit
- Define a clear need → Validate it with users → Align your solution directly with that need.

## Case Study Examples

## Final Thoughts

Needs are the foundation of value creation. Whether you are building a product, writing ad copy, or designing a [[pitch]] deck, always start with the question:

> “What real need are we solving, and how painful or important is it?”

Being customer-centric means constantly re-evaluating whether your solution still addresses a core, active, and growing need.
