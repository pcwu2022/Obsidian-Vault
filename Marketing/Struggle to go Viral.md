**1. Introduction and Research Intent:**

- The research addresses the challenge of effective communication in the saturated digital environment of the NTU台大學生交流版 [[Facebook]] group, a vital communication hub for NTU students and local businesses.
- The primary goal is to empower researchers and students to maximize their message's impact by understanding and leveraging user engagement patterns.
- This study aims to discover effective communication strategies to increase the visibility and influence of posts within the NTU Facebook group.

**2. Significance and Stakes:**

- Mastering social media engagement is crucial in the [[attention]]-driven digital landscape.
- Effective communication can significantly impact the reach and success of students, researchers, and small businesses, enabling them to achieve societal, educational, and research goals.
- The research aims to level the playing field, allowing those with limited resources to reach a broad audience.

**3. Challenges and Obstacles:**

- The primary challenge is the overwhelming volume of content within the NTU Facebook group, which often leads to important messages being overlooked.
- Identifying key characteristics that drive higher engagement is essential. These characteristics include timing, imagery, language use, and audience understanding.
- This study aims to overcome these challenges by providing data-driven insights.

**4. Literature Review and Existing Solutions:**

- **Lagerwerf & Govaert (2021):**
    - Examined the impact of headline characteristics (consonance, eliteness, negativity, novelty, personalization, proximity, forward referencing, language intensity) on click-through rates ([[CTR]]).
    - Found that negativity, forward referencing, and language intensity significantly increased CTR.
    - It is noted that this study was conducted in the Netherlands.
- **Golan et al. (2008):**
    - Applied Taylor's six-segment message [[strategy]] wheel to analyze viral ads, focusing on informational (transmission) and emotional (ritual) appeals.
    - Identified humor, sexuality, and the use of animals as common elements in viral ads.
    - This study was conducted in the United States.
- **Bridging the Insights:**
    - Both studies offer valuable insights into online engagement, but their applicability to the specific cultural context of the NTU Facebook group is limited due to geographical and cultural differences.
    - This research aims to bridge this gap by conducting a localized analysis.

**5. Research Methodology:**

- **Data Collection:** Web scraping was used to gather data from the NTU Facebook group.
- **Data Analysis:**
    - Textual data were analyzed using keyword analysis and machine learning-based semantic analysis.
    - Visual elements were evaluated for their impact on post popularity.
- **Experimental Validation:**
    - A questionnaire-based experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of identified strategies and hypotheses.
    - The experiment included comparisons of real NTU facebook posts with manipulated variables, such as prize types, images, and text placement.

**6. Key Findings and Results:**

- **Timing:** Posts made during early evening hours (around 18:00) received the highest engagement. Early morning posts had the lowest engagement.
- **Prizes:** Posts offering brownies or cash incentives generated significantly higher engagement than those offering convenience store coupons or [[Starbucks]] prizes.
- **Prize Placement:** Explicitly mentioning the prize in the first line of the post increased engagement.
- **Visual Elements:**
    - Posts with memes and cat images were highly engaging.
    - Any image, regardless of the prize's value, increased engagement.
- **Questionnaire Results:**
    - Confirmed the importance of prize placement and visual elements.
    - Revealed that images can neutralize the impact of prize value.
- **Visual Aids:**
    - Graph 1: Reactions by Time Posted (Box Plot)
    - Graph 2: Reactions by Prize Given (Scatter Plot)
    - Screenshots of the ads used in the questionnaire would greatly enhance the explanation.

**7. Conclusion:**

- The research identified effective strategies for enhancing user engagement on the NTU Facebook group, including optimal posting times, prize incentives, and the use of visual and textual elements.
- The findings provide practical, data-driven insights for students, researchers, and small businesses.
- The study highlights the importance of cultural context in social media engagement.

**8. Potential Problems and Limitations:**

- **Temporal Relevance:** User engagement patterns may change over time.
- **Data Integrity and Sampling Bias:** Web scraping and a limited questionnaire sample size may not fully represent user behavior.
- **Generalizability:** Findings may not be applicable to all content types or user groups.
- **Technical Restrictions:** The inability to analyze image content comprehensively is a significant limitation.
- **Future Research:**
    - Ongoing monitoring and adaptation of strategies.
    - Expanding sample size and variables.
    - Exploring cultural and demographic variations.
    - In-depth image content analysis.
