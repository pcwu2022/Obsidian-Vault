    - Like public goods, they are not excludable but are rival in consumption.
    - This leads to the **tragedy of the commons**, where overuse occurs because individuals do not consider the negative impact of their consumption on others (a negative externality).
    - Examples include clean air and water, congested roads, and wildlife.
    - Potential solutions involve government regulation (e.g., taxes, quotas) or creating private property rights.
