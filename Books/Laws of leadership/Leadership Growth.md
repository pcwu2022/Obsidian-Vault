Leadership develops daily, not in a day

 > The secret of our success is found in our daily agenda
 > If your hope is to make a fortune in a day, you're not going to be successful

Leaders are learners

> Champions don't become champions in the ring; they are merely recognized there


### Four phases of leadership growth
1. I don't know what I don't know
2. I know what I don't know
3. I grow and know and it starts to show
4. I simply go because of what I know
