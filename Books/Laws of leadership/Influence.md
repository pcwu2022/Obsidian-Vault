The true measure of leadership is influence - nothing more, nothing less.

 > You have achieved excellence as a leader when people will follow you everywhere if only out of curiosity.

The only thing a title can buy is a little time - either to increase your level of influence with others or erase it.

> The very essence of all power to influence lies in getting the other person to participate.

> He who thinks he leads, but has no followers, is only taking a walk

### Five myths of influence
1. Managers can maintain direction, but they can't change it
2. Entrepreneurs are not always leaders
3. IQ doesn't necessarily equate to leadership
4. Who is out in front of a crowd is not necessarily a leader
5. It's not the position that makes the leader; it's the leader that makes the position
