People naturally follow leaders stronger than themselves

> When people respect someone as a person, they admire her. When they respect her as a friend, they love her. When they respect her as a leader, they follow her.
> The more leadership ability a person has, the more quickly he recognizes leadership - or its lack - in others.

Followers are attracted to people who are better leaders than themselves.
It doesn't take long for people to recognize the strongest leaders and to follow them.

> The leader must know, must know he knows, and must be able to make it abundantly clear to those about him that he knows.
> The greatest test of respect comes when a leader creates major change in an organization.
