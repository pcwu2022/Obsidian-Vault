## The Law of Solid Ground
Trust is the foundation of leadership

Your people know when you make mistakes. The real question is whether you're going to 'fess up'. If you do, you can often quickly regain their trust.

> When it comes to leadership, you just can't take shortcuts, no matter how long you've been leading your people.
> To build trust, a leader must exemplify competence, connection, and character.
> Leadership is a potent combination of strategy and character. But if you must be without one, be without strategy.

Character makes trust possible. And trust makes leadership possible.

> People will tolerate honest mistakes, but if you violate their trust you will find it very difficult to ever regain their confidence.
> You can't get too much done in life if you only work on the days when you feel good.

If your people don't know what to expect from you as a leader, at some point they won't look to you for leadership.

> No man can climb out beyond the limitations of his own character.
> You don't build trust by talking about it. You build it by achieving results, always with integrity and in a manner that shows real personal regard for the people with whom you work.
> How do leaders earn respect? By making sound decisions, admitting their mistakes, and putting what's best for their followers and the organization ahead of their personal agendas.
