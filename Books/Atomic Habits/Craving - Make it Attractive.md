The second law of behavior change, as described in _Atomic Habits_, is to "Make It Attractive." This principle focuses on increasing the appeal of habits to enhance motivation and consistency.

### The Role of Dopamine in Habits

- Dopamine drives motivation and reinforces behaviors.
- Anticipation of a reward is often more powerful than the reward itself.
- Example: Looking forward to a post-workout smoothie increases motivation to exercise.

### Temptation Bundling

- Pairing an enjoyable activity with a necessary habit makes the habit more appealing.
- Example: "I will listen to my favorite podcast while running on the treadmill."
- This method increases the likelihood of sticking to a habit by associating it with pleasure.

### The [[Influence]] of Social Environment

- We naturally adopt habits that are common in our peer groups.
- Surrounding yourself with people who exhibit the desired behavior strengthens commitment.
- Example: Joining a fitness group increases the chances of maintaining an exercise habit.

### Creating an Attractive Habit Environment

- Adjusting your surroundings to make good habits visually and mentally appealing.
- Example: Keeping healthy snacks visible and accessible encourages better eating habits.
