The fourth law of behavior change, as outlined in _Atomic Habits_, is to "Make It Satisfying." This principle focuses on the importance of immediate rewards in reinforcing new habits and ensuring long-term consistency.

### The Power of Immediate Rewards

- People are more likely to repeat behaviors that provide instant gratification.
- The habit must be enjoyable in the short term to encourage repetition.
- Example: Marking an 'X' on a calendar each day you complete a habit provides immediate visual satisfaction.

### Habit Tracking

- Keeping track of habit completion reinforces consistency.
- Visual indicators, such as checklists or habit-tracking apps, provide motivation.
- Example: Using a step counter to monitor daily physical activity encourages movement.

### Never Miss Twice Rule

- If a habit is skipped, making sure to get back on track immediately prevents habit decay.
- Example: If you miss a workout one day, ensure you exercise the next day.

### Accountability and Social Reinforcement

- Publicly committing to a habit increases accountability.
- Example: Sharing progress with a friend or joining a group with similar goals enhances commitment.
