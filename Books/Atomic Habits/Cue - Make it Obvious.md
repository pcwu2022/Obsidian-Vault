The first law of behavior change, as outlined in _Atomic Habits_, is to "Make It Obvious." This principle emphasizes the importance of clear cues in forming and maintaining habits.

### Habit Cues and Environment Design

- Habits are triggered by cues in our environment.
- Modifying our surroundings can make good habits easier and bad habits harder.
- Example: Placing a water bottle on your desk as a reminder to stay hydrated.

### Habit Stacking

- Pairing a new habit with an existing one increases the likelihood of success.
- Example: "After I brush my teeth, I will do five push-ups."
- This method leverages established routines to introduce new behaviors seamlessly.

### Implementation Intentions

- Clearly stating when and where a habit will take place strengthens commitment.
- Format: "I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]."
- Example: "I will meditate for five minutes at 7 AM in my bedroom."

### The Role of Awareness

- Identifying current habits through a Habit Scorecard helps recognize patterns.
- Once a habit is acknowledged, it can be modified or reinforced accordingly.
