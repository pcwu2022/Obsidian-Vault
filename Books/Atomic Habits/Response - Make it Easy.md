The third law of behavior change, as explained in _Atomic Habits_, is to "Make It Easy." This principle highlights the importance of reducing friction and simplifying the process of forming new habits.

### The Law of Least Effort

- People naturally gravitate toward the path of least resistance.
- Making habits easy to start increases the likelihood of consistency.
- Example: Keeping a book on your nightstand makes it easier to build a reading habit.

### The Two-Minute Rule

- A habit should start with an action that takes less than two minutes.
- Example: Instead of "I will run five miles," start with "I will put on my running shoes."
- Scaling down habits removes resistance and builds [[Momentum]].

### Reducing Friction

- Minimizing the number of steps needed to complete a habit makes it more sustainable.
- Example: Preparing gym clothes the night before reduces effort in the morning.

### Automation and Habit Reinforcement

- Using technology or environmental changes to support habits.
- Example: Setting up automatic savings deposits encourages financial discipline.
