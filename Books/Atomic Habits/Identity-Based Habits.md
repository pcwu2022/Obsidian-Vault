Identity-based habits focus on changing who you believe you are rather than just what you do. This concept, introduced in _Atomic Habits_, emphasizes that true behavior change starts with a shift in identity.

### The Three Layers of Behavior Change

1. **Outcomes** – Changing results (e.g., losing weight, running a marathon).
2. **Processes** – Changing habits and systems (e.g., exercising regularly, eating healthier).
3. **Identity** – Changing beliefs and self-perception (e.g., "I am a runner," rather than "I want to run a marathon").

### How to Build Identity-Based Habits

- **Decide the type of person you want to become.**
    - Example: Instead of focusing on writing a book, identify as a writer.
- **Prove your identity with small wins.**
    - Example: If you want to be fit, start with small workouts that reinforce that identity.

### Reinforcing Your Identity

- Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become.
- Example: If you consistently choose to read, you reinforce the identity of being a reader.
- The goal is to align actions with identity to create sustainable change.
