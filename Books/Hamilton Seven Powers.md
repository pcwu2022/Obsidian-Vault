### What is a "Power"?

In this framework, **Power** is defined as the mechanism that enables a business to **sustain superior returns** over time. It’s not just about momentary advantages or operational excellence, but long-term defensibility. The seven powers are conditions that, once established, are difficult for competitors to replicate.

## [[Economies of Scale]]

**Definition:** Cost advantages that arise with increased production volume.
**Mechanism:** As production increases, the per-unit cost decreases due to fixed cost spread, operational efficiencies, or network effects.
**Example:** [[Amazon]] in logistics and warehousing; larger volumes reduce the marginal cost per delivery.
**Defensibility:** Hard for smaller competitors to match without incurring higher costs.

## [[Network Effects]]

**Definition:** A product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it.
**Mechanism:** Each new user increases the value of the network for all users, creating a positive feedback loop.
**Example:** [[Facebook]], [[WhatsApp]], and [[LinkedIn]]—more users mean more content and connections, increasing user retention.
**Defensibility:** Switching costs and value decline in smaller, competing networks.

## [[Counter-Positioning]]

**Definition:** A newcomer adopts a superior business model which incumbents cannot imitate due to conflicts with their existing operations.
**Mechanism:** The incumbent’s current assets, customer expectations, or business model would be devalued by adopting the new approach.
**Example:** [[Netflix]] vs [[Blockbuster]]—Blockbuster couldn’t shift to streaming without hurting its retail revenue and operations.
**Defensibility:** Incumbents are trapped by legacy constraints.

## [[Switching Costs]]

**Definition:** The cost (financial, emotional, procedural) for a customer to switch to a competitor is high.
**Mechanism:** Customers stay due to contracts, integrations, learning curves, or data lock-in.
**Example:** [[Adobe Creative Cloud]], [[Apple]] ecosystem—users are disincentivized to switch due to software familiarity, file formats, or connected devices.
**Defensibility:** High user friction reduces churn.

## [[Brand]]

**Definition:** The perception of quality, trust, or prestige that allows a business to charge a premium or earn loyalty.
**Mechanism:** Brand signals reduce perceived risk or provide emotional connection, especially in categories with information asymmetry.
**Example:** [[Nike]], [[Apple]], [[Coca-Cola]]—strong brand equity allows pricing power and customer loyalty.
**Defensibility:** Time-consuming and expensive to replicate; often reinforced through consistent quality and marketing.

## [[Cornered Resource]]

**Definition:** Exclusive access to a resource that is essential for the business’s success.
**Mechanism:** This could be a patent, exclusive contract, talent, content, or regulatory license.
**Example:** [[Marvel]]’s IP portfolio; exclusive access to top creative talent or government spectrum licenses.
**Defensibility:** Competitors can't access the same critical inputs.

## [[Process Power]]

**Definition:** Superior processes and know-how developed over time that are deeply embedded in the company’s culture and operations.
**Mechanism:** Often includes tacit knowledge, training, and systems that increase efficiency or quality.
**Example:** [[Toyota]]’s lean manufacturing; [[Amazon]]’s fulfillment systems.
**Defensibility:** Hard to copy due to complexity and need for long-term organizational commitment.
