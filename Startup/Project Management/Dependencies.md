Dependencies refer to the relationships or reliance between different tasks, resources, or components in a project or system.

### Types of Dependencies
1. Task Dependencies (Project Management):
   - Certain tasks must be completed before others can begin.
   - Example: You need to build a foundation before constructing walls.

2. Resource Dependencies:
   - A task relies on specific resources (e.g., equipment, personnel) to proceed.
   - Example: A photoshoot depends on the availability of a photographer.

3. Software/Technology Dependencies:
   - A system or application relies on specific software, libraries, or tools.
   - Example: A Python project might depend on libraries like NumPy or Pandas.

4. Process Dependencies:
   - Steps in a workflow depend on prior steps being completed correctly.
   - Example: Manufacturing depends on material delivery.

### Importance of Managing Dependencies
- Avoid Delays: Unmanaged dependencies can lead to bottlenecks.
- Ensure Smooth Workflow: Proper coordination keeps processes aligned.
- Improve Planning: Identifying dependencies helps in accurate scheduling and resource allocation.
