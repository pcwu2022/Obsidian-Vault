A Kanban board is a visual tool used in project management to help teams organize and track work progress. It uses columns to represent different stages of a workflow, and tasks are moved across these columns as they progress from start to completion. The goal is to improve efficiency, visualize bottlenecks, and manage tasks in a flexible and collaborative way.

### Key Features of a Kanban Board
1. Columns: Each column represents a stage in the workflow (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
2. Cards: Each task is represented by a card that moves through the columns as it progresses.
3. Work in Progress (WIP) Limits: Set limits on how many tasks can be in each stage at any time to avoid bottlenecks.
