A Gantt chart is a visual tool used in project management to represent the timeline of a project. It shows the start and end dates of various tasks or milestones and their dependencies, helping teams track progress and manage deadlines.

### Key Features of a Gantt Chart
1. Tasks/Activities: Listed on the vertical axis, representing the steps or activities required to complete the project.
2. Timeline: Displayed on the horizontal axis, often broken down by days, weeks, or months.
3. Bars: Horizontal bars represent the duration of each task, showing when they start and end.
4. Dependencies: Arrows or lines connecting tasks to show which tasks need to be completed before others can start.
