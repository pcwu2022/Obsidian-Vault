The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a period longer than one year. It’s one of the most accurate ways to calculate and determine returns for individual assets, investment portfolios, and anything that can rise or fall in value over time.

- The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is a mathematical formula that provides a pro forma number that tells you what an investment yields on an annually compounded basis.
- CAGR is the best formula for evaluating how different investments have performed over time.
- Investment results can vary depending on the time periods that are used.
- Investors can use a risk-adjusted CAGR to compare the performance and risk characteristics between investment alternatives.
- The CAGR isn’t ideal if it’s used to promote investment results without incorporating the risk factor.

Assume you invested $1,000 at the beginning of 2022 and your investment was worth $3,000 by year’s end, a 200% return. The market corrected the next year and you lost 50%, ending up with $1,500 at the end of 2023.

Using average annual return doesn’t provide the return on your investment for the period. The average annual return on this investment was 75% (the average of a 200% gain and a 50% loss) but the result was $1,500, not $3,065, in this two-year period: $1,000 for two years at an annual rate of 75%. You have to calculate the CAGR to determine what your annual return was for the period.

Take the nth root of the total return to calculate the CAGR where n is the number of years you held the investment. This calculation is the geometric mean. Take the square root of 50% (the total return for the period) in this example because your investment was for two years. You obtain a CAGR of 22.5%.
