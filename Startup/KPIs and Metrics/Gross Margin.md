**Gross margin** is a financial metric that measures a company’s profitability after accounting for the direct costs of producing its goods or services, typically expressed as a percentage. It indicates how efficiently a company is generating profit from its core operations before considering other expenses such as administrative costs, taxes, and interest.

### Formula:

Gross Margin (%) = ((Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue) × 100

- **Revenue**: Total income from sales of goods or services.
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs associated with producing goods or delivering services (e.g., raw materials, labor).

### Example:

If a company has:

- Revenue: $500,000
- COGS: $300,000

Gross Margin (%) = (($500,000 - $300,000) / $500,000) × 100 = 40%

This means the company retains 40% of each dollar earned in revenue after covering production costs.

### Importance:

1. **Profitability Indicator**: Higher gross margins mean the company retains more money to cover operating expenses and profit.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Reflects how well a company manages its production costs.
3. **Industry Comparison**: Allows comparison of profitability across competitors within the same industry.

A healthy gross margin varies by industry. For example:

- Software companies often have high gross margins (70-90%) due to low production costs.
- Retail or manufacturing industries tend to have lower margins (20-50%) due to higher material and labor costs.
