One common metric to measure [[Retention]] is the **Customer Retention Rate (CRR)**, calculated as:

((Customers at End of Period - New Customers Acquired) / Customers at Start of Period) x100

If a business has 1,000 customers at the beginning of the month, gains 100 new ones, and ends the month with 950, the CRR would be 85%

This means the company retained 85% of its customers, which helps gauge customer satisfaction and loyalty.
