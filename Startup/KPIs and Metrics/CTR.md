CTR, or **Click-Through Rate**, is a metric that shows the percentage of people who click on a specific link out of the total who view it. Itâ€™s commonly used in digital marketing to measure the effectiveness of ads, emails, or links on a webpage. 

CTR = Number of Clicks / Number of Impressions x 100%

For example, if an ad is shown 1,000 times and receives 50 clicks, the CTR would be 5%. A higher CTR indicates that more people found the link compelling enough to click, making it an important metric for evaluating engagement.
