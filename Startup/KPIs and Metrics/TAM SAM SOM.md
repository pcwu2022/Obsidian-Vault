# TAM, SAM, SOM: The Market Analysis Framework

The market analysis framework uses three key metrics to evaluate business potential and attract investors by demonstrating market opportunity in a structured manner.

## Core Concepts

|Metric|Definition|Metaphor|
|---|---|---|
|**TAM** (Total Addressable Market)|Maximum theoretical revenue with 100% market share|Entire iceberg|
|**SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market)|Market segment that can be served by your products|Underwater portion|
|**SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market)|Actual market share you can realistically capture|Visible tip|

## Calculation Methods

**Top-down approach:**

- Start with industry-wide data
- Apply relevant conversion factors
- Use discount factors based on research
- Determine realistic market segments

**Bottom-up approach:**

- Base on actual customer metrics
- Extrapolate from existing data
- Cross-check with top-down calculations
- Ensure logical consistency

## Example: Phone Screen Protector Business

- **TAM**: Entire Taiwan screen protector market
- **SAM**: University area market potential if dominant
- **SOM**: Realistic first-year revenue projection

## Strategic Considerations

- TAM should be optimistically large to justify investment
- SAM requires more precision but remains somewhat optimistic
- SOM must be realistic and defensible
- New startups should conduct small experiments to estimate SOM

## Investor Perspective

- Investors seek businesses with large TAM potential
- They evaluate the ratio between investment and market opportunity
- SOM projections become accountability metrics
- Board members track performance against these projections

## Practical Tips

- Present as the market authority
- Make defensible assumptions
- Ensure coherence between calculation methods
- Balance optimism with realism
- Tell a clear, convincing story

## Importance for Startups

Investors prefer a balanced TAM approach. Extremely high TAM figures suggest heavy competition, while low TAM indicates limited growth potential. The ideal TAM shows significant growth room while remaining attainable.

## Creating Compelling Market Analysis

1. Use bottom-up analysis for credibility
2. Avoid inflating numbers with irrelevant segments
3. Define clear geographic scope
4. Base calculations on defensible pricing assumptions
5. Demonstrate growth potential over time

In fast-evolving markets, initial TAM estimates may appear conservative but can expand dramatically as the market develops, similar to how tech giants like Google and Facebook grew beyond initial projections.

The framework serves as both a strategic planning tool and a communication device for investors, helping startups articulate their market potential while demonstrating a realistic understanding of their business opportunity.
