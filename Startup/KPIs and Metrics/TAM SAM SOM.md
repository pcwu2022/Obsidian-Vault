## What is TAM, SAM & SOM

**TAM** = Total Addressable Market (Or Total Available Market)—This represents the revenue opportunity that a company has if it has a full 100% of the market share, and there is no competition.

**SAM** = Serviceable Addressable Market—This represents the “slice” of the TAM “pie” that can be served by a company’s products and services.

**SOM** = Serviceable Obtainable Market—This represents the _actual_ amount of the market that is being served by the company’s products and services.

These three terms are related to one another, and are generally depicted as a series of three circles, with SOM being nested in SAM, and subsequently nested within TAM:

### TAM

The Total Addressable Market (TAM) is the theoretical maximum revenue a company could achieve if every potential customer converted and paid the highest price possible. While TAM indicates the potential scale of a business, it's unrealistic since no company captures the entire market. TAM calculations help inform strategy and attract investors but assume monopolistic control, which is rare due to competition.

To calculate TAM, there are three methods:

1. **Top-Down**: Uses industry reports for broad market estimates, though the data might not be fully relevant or current.
2. **Bottom-Up**: Estimates based on previous sales and [[Pricing]]; for example, multiplying the number of potential customers by the annual revenue per customer.
3. **Value Theory**: Useful in innovative sectors where customers might pay a premium for unique features.

### SAM

The Serviceable Available Market (SAM) refines TAM by focusing on the portion of the market the company can realistically serve based on product relevance. Calculating SAM typically uses a bottom-up approach, focusing on a specific segment of TAM.

### SOM

The Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) reflects the actual market share captured by the company. SOM calculations are usually based on past market share and SAM adjustments. Estimating SOM helps businesses understand their competitive position and potential growth.

### Importance of TAM, SAM, and SOM for Startups
Investors look for a balanced TAM. A high TAM suggests heavy competition, while a low TAM may signal limited growth potential. Investors prefer a TAM that shows room for growth but is realistically attainable. SAM and SOM figures help investors assess competition and market entry strategies.

### Tips for Creating a Compelling TAM Slide
1. **Use Bottom-Up Analysis**: This approach shows detailed market understanding.
2. **Accurate Numbers**: Avoid inflating TAM with irrelevant customer segments.
3. **Clear Geographic Scope**: If focused locally, avoid global data.
4. **Realistic [[Pricing]]**: Base calculations on defensible assumptions.
5. **Future Vision**: Show TAM growth potential over time.

### Market Size Resources
Entrepreneurs should engage in their own market research by:
- Analyzing online reports,
- Reviewing competitor financials,
- Consulting industry experts,
- Using online research tools.

In fast-evolving sectors, TAM estimates might initially appear low but can grow as the market and product evolve, as seen with tech giants like Google and Facebook.
