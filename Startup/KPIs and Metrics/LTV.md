LTV, or **Lifetime Value**: The total revenue a business can expect from a single customer over the entire duration of their relationship with the company.

LTV = Average Purchase Value x Purchase Frequency x Customer Lifespan

For example, if a customer spends $50 per month and remains a customer for two years, their LTV would be $1,200. Maximizing LTV can increase a company's profitability and reduce the need for acquiring new customers.
