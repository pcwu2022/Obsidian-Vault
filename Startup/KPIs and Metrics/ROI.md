**ROI**, or **Return on Investment**, is a financial metric used to measure the profitability or efficiency of an investment. It indicates the percentage return earned on an investment relative to its cost, helping investors or businesses evaluate the performance of different investments or projects.

### Formula:

ROI (%) = ((Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment) × 100

### Components:

1. **Gain from Investment**: The total returns generated (e.g., revenue, profits, or savings).
2. **Cost of Investment**: The total amount spent to make the investment (e.g., initial purchase price, operational costs).

### Example:

If a company spends $10,000 on an investment and earns $12,000 in return:

**ROI** = [($12,000 - $10,000) / $10,000] × 100 = 20%

This means the company earned a 20% return on the investment.

### Why Is ROI Important?

1. **Profitability Assessment**:
    
    - Provides a clear measure of the financial benefit derived from an investment.
2. **Comparison Tool**:
    
    - Helps compare the profitability of different investments, making it easier to allocate resources effectively.
3. **Decision-Making**:
    
    - Aids in evaluating whether an investment is worthwhile based on potential returns.

### Limitations:

1. **Ignores Time**:
    
    - ROI does not consider how long it takes to achieve the return. For instance, a 20% ROI over 1 year is more attractive than over 5 years.
2. **Excludes Risk**:
    
    - It does not factor in the risk involved in achieving the returns.
3. **Ambiguity in Costs and Gains**:
    
    - Definitions of "gain" and "cost" may vary, leading to inconsistent comparisons.

### Variations:

1. **Annualized ROI**:
    - Adjusts ROI to reflect returns over a specific period, addressing the time limitation.
2. **Social ROI (SROI)**:
    - Accounts for social or environmental benefits in addition to financial returns, used in social impact projects.

ROI is a simple yet powerful metric to evaluate investments, but for deeper insights, it's often complemented with other measures like **Net Present Value ([[NPV]])** or **Internal Rate of Return ([[IRR]])**.
