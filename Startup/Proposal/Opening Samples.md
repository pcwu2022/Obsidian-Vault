**Without it, NTU Will Never Be on the Map!**

As known to all, National Taiwan University (NTU) has been endeavoring to enhance its position within the prestigious ranking of the world’s top 100 universities. The institution confronts two primary challenges in consolidating its standing: the moderate impact of its scientific research outputs and the level of students’ academic proficiency as reported in the _Asia Report_, 2020. As the idiom states, “You cannot make bricks without straw.” To put NTU on the top of the world map of teaching and research excellence, the first step should be to “sharpen students’ tool”—promoting the services of NTU library. A 24-hour library enables better workflow and heightens academic productivity, hence the value of this proposal.

**Losing TEN HOURS each day, keep the TOP TEN away**

The relationship between library opening hours and student study patterns is well-documented, yet the impact of these hours on academic productivity may not be as widely recognized. For instance, at National Taiwan University (NTU), there is a recorded 10% decrease in student academic productivity after 10 p.m. Additionally, a study published in the Journal of _Academic Librarianship_ (2012) indicates that nearly 13% of students exhibit increased productivity during nighttime hours. In a sense, what is shut down at 10 p.m. is not only the NTU library, but also a significant portion of student potential in terms of mobility, creativity, and intellectual capacity. Consequently, there is a compelling argument for extending the operational hours of the university library to foster academic progress.

**Seven Million Books Await Users: Own the Key to a House of Gold!**

Every night person shares this same experience: whenever your thoughts and ideas come flowing, the Closed sign hanging on the library door seems to be the only thing standing in between you and the completion of your masterpiece. Carolyn Schur, a consulting psychologist, revealed in her 2017 study encompassing 48 universities that over 40% of students identify as night owls. This [[Insight]] has promoted a reevaluation of certain educational policies, most notably the conventional operational hours of university libraries. Hence, many prestigious universities like Peking University and the University of Oxford have offered 24/7 libraries with the available resources of reference books, wireless internet, and seminar rooms. In comparison, National Taiwan University (NTU) provides its students 14-hour service time with relatively small, crowded study rooms. This proposal posits that to honor the learning patterns of the majority and to maximize resource utilization, the establishment of a 24-hour library is imperative.

**Midnight library, night-time amenity: Roomie-Forbidden!**

The air was stuffy, the AC went out, and my work on the final project was going nowhere. Sitting at my laptop in the noisy dorm, I felt the anxiety rushing through my veins, and my heart pounded heavily with stress. It was half an hour to midnight, and I yearned for an escape from the endless tiresome. So, I embarked on my trip to the library for random research. Flipping through old journals and documents for hours and hours, and voila, more ideas popped into my head. What if these could all be true? What if there is a 24-hour library on the campus here, in NTU? My intention is to realize this dream of most students—to immerse in the ocean of knowledge, free from spatio-temporal constraints.

**With Everything but Time Limits!**

More and more world top universities are offering 24-hour library services. For National Taiwan University (NTU) to enhance its competitiveness, it must align with international standards rather than fall behind. While debates persist over nighttime library operations, we contend that the benefits surpass the drawbacks, a stance underpinned by several compelling reasons: firstly, extending hours offers time flexibility and convenience, leading to increased library utilization; secondly, it enhances students’ study efficiency and decreases time spent commuting; and thirdly, it provides night owls with an optimal study environment, simultaneously preserving a tranquil sleep setting in the dormitories for those who rise early.
