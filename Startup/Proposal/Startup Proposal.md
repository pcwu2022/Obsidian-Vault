## Purpose and Audience Tailoring

A well-crafted [[startup]] proposal should be tailored to its [[Target Audience]], as different stakeholders care about different aspects of a business:

- Operations Team: Interested in developmental milestones—product launch timeline, revenue targets, patent count, user growth, etc.
    
- Banks (Loans): Focus on financial health, emphasizing detailed revenue, [[gross margin]], and net profit figures.
    
- Government (Grants): Looks for innovation and quantifiable KPIs, with a clear [[roadmap]] of execution and measurable outcomes.
    
- Investors (Fundraising): Prioritize profitability models, capital allocation, and equity planning—seeking 2–10x return on investment, not just dividends.
    


## Writing Best Practices

- Visual Hierarchy: Use visuals to enhance clarity—Images > Tables > Text.
    
- Structured Content: Organize information using Main headings → Subheadings → Bullet points.
    
- Clear Executive Summary: The first 200–500 words should clearly outline the [[value proposition]], [[Target Audience]], and [[business model]].
    
- Powerful First Page: Immediately highlight the startup’s unique advantage to capture [[attention]].
    


## Core Elements of a [[Business Model]]

### [[Value Proposition]] & Differentiation

- Offer unique [[Market]] value, not just price competition.
    
- The core of any business model is value exchange—clearly define what your value is.
    
- Use branding (e.g., _Made in Japan_) to increase product perceived value.
    

### Revenue Model & Market [[Strategy]]

- Explore non-linear revenue models, such as cross-subsidization (e.g., “give away pajamas, charge for shipping”).
    
- Form strategic alliances to amplify market reach and resource efficiency.
    
- Plan for iterative improvements in the business model to stay ahead of competitors.
    


## Business Model Case Studies

1. Free Pajama Model:
    
    - Pajamas retail at NT$188; bulk production reduces cost to NT$8.
        
    - Customers pay NT$23 for shipping, with a real cost of NT$5 → NT$7 profit per unit.
        
    - Due to Taiwan’s small market, scalable alternatives should be considered.
        
2. Physical Retail Challenges:
    
    - Disruptive pricing alone isn’t enough—distributors and resellers must also earn profit.
        
    - Entering chain stores requires going through resellers and ensuring profit margins across the supply chain.
        
    - Pricing strategy should balance cost, consumer acceptability, and margin distribution.
        


## Types of Business Models & Innovations

### Common Models

1. Wholesale & Retail – Sourcing from Taobao, selling via Shopee.
    
2. F&B Sector – Low entry barrier, high competition; franchise models common.
    
3. Distributors & System Integrators – Bundling products from different vendors to serve end clients.
    
4. Platform Services – Matchmaking [[supply and demand]], must offer irreplaceable value.
    
5. Information Asymmetry / Process Gaps – Identify breakpoints in workflows to prevent disintermediation.
    

### Innovative Models

1. Home-visit Dentistry:
    
    - Clearly differentiate service recipient (bedridden elderly) and decision-maker (caregivers).
        
    - Use [[SEO]] and word-of-mouth to gain clients without ads.
        
    - Provide a professional team to offload responsibilities from caregivers.
        
2. Automated Tools for SMEs:
    
    - Build solutions using free tools (Line Bot, cloud DBs) tailored to small businesses.
        
    - Leverage information asymmetry to monetize otherwise free utilities.
        
    - Increase value through consulting services, improving business efficiency.
        


## Fundraising & Equity Planning

### Investor Types & Communication

- VCs: Prioritize financial returns—be clear about potential multiples and exit paths.
    
- Angel Investors: Drawn to vision, social impact, and team story.
    
- Local (Taiwan-based) Investors: Often EMBA alumni, reachable via networking.
    

### Equity & Legal Structure

- Corporations: Voting power by investment size; Limited Partnerships: voting per shareholder.
    
- Define early shareholder agreements: exits, future rounds, roles, etc.
    
- Professional advisors (lawyers, accountants) are essential for regulatory and financial guidance.
    

### Building Credibility

- Join startup competitions (e.g., NTU Garage, FITI, U-Start) to build legitimacy.
    
- Consider markets like the Taiwan Innovation Board to elevate brand perception.
    
- Recruit academic/industry mentors to boost team credibility and [[trust]].
    


## Market Expansion & Trend Alignment

### Targeting & Scaling

- Clearly define your audience: Who are they? What do they need?
    
- Strategize for scaling: Local dominance first or go global? Understand required certifications (e.g., FBA, CE, 3C).
    
- High-margin opportunities lie in personalized premium services—e.g., home fitness coaching, private nurses.
    

### Trend Analysis & Data Support

- Align with government policy (e.g., “Healthy Taiwan”) to improve grant eligibility.
    
- Focus on rising sectors: smart healthcare, eldercare, and AI-enhanced services.
    
- Use official statistics (e.g., aging population growth) to prove market demand.
