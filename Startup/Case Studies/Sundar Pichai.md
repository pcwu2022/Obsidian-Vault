### Early Life in India
Sundar Pichai was born on **June 10, 1972**, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, into a modest family. His father was an electrical engineer at a British conglomerate, and his mother was a stenographer.

Pichai’s success with the Toolbar led to his involvement in the development of **Google Chrome**, the company’s web browser.
