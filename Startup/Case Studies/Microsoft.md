### The Origins: Vision Meets Opportunity (1975)

Founders: [[Bill Gates]] and Paul Allen  
Context: The release of the MITS Altair 8800—an early microcomputer—marked a shift from mainframes to personal computers (PCs).

Key Moment #1 – First Big Break: BASIC for Altair (1975)  
Gates and Allen saw a future where software would be as important as hardware. They developed a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair 8800 and licensed it to MITS.

> Takeaway: Visionaries spot trends early. Gates and Allen saw the PC revolution before it happened and built the _first software_ for it.

### Establishing Microsoft (1975–1980)

- 1975: Microsoft (then “Micro-Soft”) was founded in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
    
- 1976: Gates writes the famous "Open Letter to Hobbyists," arguing against software piracy.
    
- 1980: They license a BASIC interpreter to several hardware companies, building a steady revenue stream.
    

> Takeaway: Monetize intellectual property. Gates was one of the first to argue that _software has value_ and should be protected like any asset.

### Key Moment #2 – MS-DOS & IBM Deal (1980–1981)

IBM approached Microsoft for an operating system for their upcoming PC. Microsoft didn’t have one—so they bought one (QDOS) from Seattle Computer Products, modified it, and licensed it to IBM as MS-DOS.

Critical [[Insight]]: Microsoft retained the rights to license MS-DOS to _other_ PC manufacturers.

> Takeaway: Control the platform. License smart. Retaining rights to MS-DOS allowed Microsoft to dominate the PC OS market.

### The Explosion of PCs & Microsoft’s Rise (1981–1990)

- MS-DOS becomes the standard OS across nearly all IBM-compatible PCs.
    
- Microsoft expands into applications: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint (acquired from Forethought in 1987).
    

Key Moment #3 – [[IPO]] in 1986  
Microsoft goes public. Gates becomes a billionaire at 31. The IPO raises $61M and gives Microsoft the capital for rapid growth.

> Takeaway: Scale matters. Public capital can accelerate growth—but only if you have a product-market fit and platform leverage.

### Windows Changes Everything (1985–1995)

- 1985: Windows 1.0 is released—initially a graphical shell over MS-DOS.
    
- 1990: Windows 3.0 launches. It becomes a commercial success due to better GUI and memory management.
    
- 1995: Windows 95 is released with a full GUI, taskbar, and Start menu. It sells 1 million copies in 4 days.
    

Key Moment #4 – Owning the Desktop (Windows 95)  
Windows 95, bundled with MS Office, became the dominant PC experience. Microsoft now owned the operating system _and_ the most-used apps.

> Takeaway: Vertical integration wins. Own both the platform and key applications.

### Key Moment #5 – Missing the Internet (Mid-90s)

Microsoft initially underestimated the web. Netscape Navigator became the leading web browser.

But: Microsoft course-corrected fast:

- Created Internet Explorer.
    
- Bundled it for free with Windows.
    
- Outcompeted Netscape (leading to antitrust scrutiny).
    

> Takeaway: Be paranoid. Course-correct fast. Even if you miss a trend, a fast, aggressive pivot can save you.

### Key Moment #6 – Antitrust Lawsuit (1998–2001)

- The U.S. Department of Justice sues Microsoft for anti-competitive behavior.
    
- The court rules that Microsoft had abused monopoly power.
    
- Microsoft narrowly avoids a breakup, but its public image suffers.
    

> Takeaway: Don’t fly too close to the sun. Market dominance invites scrutiny. Leaders must balance ambition with ethical boundaries.

### Stagnation Era (2000–2013)

- 2000: Gates steps down as CEO. Steve Ballmer takes over.
    
- Microsoft misses major tech shifts:
    
    - Search (Google dominates).
        
    - Mobile ([[Apple]]'s iPhone, Android beat Windows Phone).
        
    - Social Media.
        
    - Cloud (initially slow compared to AWS).
        

Key Moment #7 – Vista Fails (2007)  
Windows Vista was poorly received: bloated, buggy, incompatible with existing systems.

> Takeaway: Legacy can become a burden. Large companies must remain agile, or their size becomes a weakness.

### ☁️ Key Moment #8 – Satya Nadella & the Cloud Pivot (2014–Present)

Satya Nadella becomes CEO in 2014.

- Shifts focus to cloud computing, AI, and cross-platform software.
    
- Launches Microsoft Azure – now 2nd in cloud behind AWS.
    
- Opened Microsoft to Linux, GitHub (acquired 2018), and multi-platform Office (even iOS & Android).
    
- Transforms Microsoft Teams into a Slack competitor.
    
- Acquires LinkedIn (2016), GitHub (2018), and Activision Blizzard (pending approval).
    

> Takeaway: Reinvention is possible—even late. [[Culture]] change, [[Openness]], and cloud-first thinking revitalized Microsoft.

### Key Moment #9 – The Rise of Azure (2015–Now)

Azure becomes central to enterprise services, AI models, and even government contracts. It now contributes a huge portion of Microsoft's revenue.

- AI with OpenAI: Microsoft invested billions in OpenAI, integrated GPT into Copilot for Office, Azure AI, and GitHub Copilot.
    

> Takeaway: Bet on the future, but support it with infrastructure. Microsoft didn’t just invest in AI—it made it usable through Azure.

### Key Moment #10 – Copilot & AI Transformation (2023–2025)

- Launches Microsoft Copilot, embedding AI into Windows, Office, Teams.
    
- AI as a _platform shift_—Microsoft uses it to reinforce its software suite, creating new lock-in.
    

> Takeaway: Don’t miss the next platform. When a new computing paradigm (AI, cloud, etc.) arrives, embrace it early, own distribution, and build tools.
