**1. Origins: The McDonald Brothers (1940)**

- **Founders:** Richard and Maurice McDonald opened “McDonald’s Bar-B-Q” in San Bernardino, California in 1940.
    
- **Original Model:** The restaurant was a typical drive-in with 25 items on the menu and carhop service.
    
- **Key [[Insight]] (1948):** Realizing that most profits came from a few items, the brothers **revolutionized fast food** by introducing the “Speedee Service System,” simplifying the menu to burgers, fries, and shakes, and focusing on **speed, consistency, and affordability.**
    
- **Impact:** This innovation reduced [[customer]] wait time from 30 minutes to 30 seconds and drastically increased efficiency and profit.
    

> **Takeaway:** Innovation isn’t always about new products—it can be about **redefining process efficiency.** Focus on the 20% of offerings that create 80% of value (Pareto Principle).

**2. Enter [[Ray Kroc]] (1954)**

- **Background:** Ray Kroc was a 52-year-old milkshake machine salesman when he discovered the McDonald brothers’ restaurant using eight of his Multi-Mixers.
    
- **Vision:** Kroc saw the potential of **franchising** the McDonald's system across the U.S.
    
- **Franchise Agreement (1954):** He convinced the brothers to let him franchise McDonald’s, forming **McDonald’s Systems, Inc.**, later renamed **McDonald’s Corporation** in 1960.
    
- **Conflict:** The McDonald brothers were conservative and reluctant to expand aggressively. Kroc wanted national scale.
    

> **Takeaway:** The **right visionary partner** can scale a good idea into a great company—but founders must be willing to evolve or risk being left behind.

**3. The Breakaway and Full Ownership (1961)**

- **Buyout:** Ray Kroc bought the exclusive rights to McDonald’s from the brothers for $2.7 million (enough for $1 million each after taxes).
    
- **Terms:** The deal supposedly included a **“handshake agreement”** for the brothers to receive a 0.5% royalty, which was never honored—causing personal bitterness.
    
- **Revenge Move:** Kroc opened a McDonald’s near the original store, eventually putting the brothers out of business.
    

> **Takeaway:** **Legal clarity and [[trust]]** are essential in partnerships and acquisitions. Emotional fallouts can result from ambiguity.

**4. Growth Through Franchising (1960s–70s)**

- **Standardization:** Kroc focused intensely on **consistency across franchises.**
    
- **Training:** Established **Hamburger University** in 1961 to train managers with a standardized curriculum.
    
- **Franchise Model Innovation:** Kroc’s genius wasn’t just selling franchises—it was in **buying real estate and leasing it to franchisees** via his company **Franchise Realty Corp.**
    
- **Result:** This created a **dual-income stream**—franchise fees and rental income.
    

> **Takeaway:** Think beyond direct sales. **Strategic control points**—like owning the supply chain or real estate—can create long-term power.

**5. [[Marketing]] and Branding Mastery**

- **Golden Arches:** Introduced in the 1960s and became one of the most recognizable symbols in the world.
    
- **Ronald McDonald:** Introduced in 1963, helped position the [[brand]] as family- and kid-friendly.
    
- **Slogans and Campaigns:** “You Deserve a Break Today,” “I’m Lovin’ It”—memorable, emotionally resonant, global.
    

> **Takeaway:** Branding isn’t just a logo—it’s a **feeling, message, and experience** that builds emotional trust.

**6. Global Expansion (1970s–1990s)**

- Entered **Japan (1971), UK (1974), China (1990), India (1996).**
    
- Each [[market]] required **local adaptation**:
    
    - India: No beef—offered Maharaja Mac (chicken), McAloo Tikki.
        
    - Japan: Smaller portions, localized menu.
        
- McDonald’s became a **symbol of globalization** and Western [[Culture]].
    

> **Takeaway:** Standardize what must be consistent ([[brand]], [[values]], process), but **localize to fit cultural nuances.**

**7. Health, Ethics, and Pushback (2000s–2010s)**

- Criticisms: Unhealthy food, obesity, labor practices, environmental harm.
    
- Media: “Supersize Me” (2004) damaged public perception.
    
- Response:
    
    - Introduced **salads, apple slices, calorie counts.**
        
    - Commitment to **sustainability**: antibiotic-free chicken, cage-free eggs, waste reduction.
        
    - **Digital upgrades**: kiosks, mobile ordering, McDelivery with [[Uber]] Eats.
        

> **Takeaway:** **Adaptability is key**—companies must evolve with shifting social values and health awareness.

**8. Modern Reinvention (2015–present)**

- **CEO Steve Easterbrook (2015–2019):** Led “turnaround plan.”
    
    - Simplified menu, improved food quality.
        
    - Rebranded stores with modern design.
        
    - Focused on **tech and data**: app-based promotions, digital loyalty programs.
        
- **McCafé:** Entered premium coffee space to compete with [[Starbucks]].
    
- **AI and automation:** Invested in Dynamic Yield for personalized drive-thru experiences.
