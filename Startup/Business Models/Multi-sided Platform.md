### Multi-Sided Platform Business Model

**Definition**  
A multi-sided platform (MSP) connects two or more distinct groups of users, facilitating interactions or transactions between them. Unlike two-sided markets, MSPs may serve more than two types of users, creating a complex ecosystem where value is exchanged between multiple groups. MSPs generate revenue by enabling and monetizing these interactions, often relying on network effects to grow.

**Key Features**

1. **Multiple User Groups**: MSPs cater to diverse participants, such as consumers, producers, advertisers, and developers.
2. **Network Effects**: The value of the platform increases as more users from one group join, attracting additional users from other groups.
3. **Intermediary Role**: The platform acts as a hub that simplifies interactions and ensures efficiency.
4. **Revenue Models**: Typically include transaction fees, subscriptions, advertising, or freemium models.
