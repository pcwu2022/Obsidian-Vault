### Definition  
The Product as a Service (PaaS) business model shifts the focus from selling a physical product to providing access or usage of the product as an ongoing service. Instead of customers owning the product, they pay for its functionality or outcomes, typically through subscription or pay-per-use agreements. This model emphasizes convenience, flexibility, and sustainability by ensuring customers receive value without the burden of ownership.
