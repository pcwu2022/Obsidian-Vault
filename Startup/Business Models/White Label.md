### White Label Business Model

**Definition**  
The White Label business model involves a product or service produced by one company and rebranded or marketed by another company as their own. The producer handles development and manufacturing, while the reseller focuses on branding, marketing, and customer engagement. This model allows companies to quickly enter the market without building products from scratch, while manufacturers scale by selling to multiple resellers.

2. **Low Entry Barrier**: Resellers can skip product development and focus on marketing and sales.
3. **Scalability for Producers**: Producers benefit from economies of scale by selling the same product to multiple businesses.
