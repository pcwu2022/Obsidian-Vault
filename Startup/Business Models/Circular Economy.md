The circular economy is a sustainable business model that focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing the reuse of resources. Unlike the traditional linear model (take, make, dispose), it emphasizes recycling, reusing, and regenerating products to extend their lifecycle and reduce environmental impact. This approach creates value by optimizing the use of materials and energy throughout the product's lifecycle.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Circular Inputs**: Replacing virgin raw materials with recyclable and renewable inputs. For example, Adidas collaborates with Parley to recycle ocean waste into sports shoes, reducing resource extraction and waste pollution.
    
2. **[[Sharing Economy]]**: Leveraging underused assets by enabling sharing or renting. Platforms like [[Uber]], GoShare, and iRent allow users to access transportation without owning it, reducing waste and increasing convenience while generating income for businesses.
    
3. **[[Product-as-a-Service]]**: Shifting from ownership to usage, where consumers pay for performance or usage, not the product itself. An example is PackAge+, which offers a rental packaging system for e-commerce, promoting sustainability by reducing packaging waste.
    
4. **Product Use Extension**: Designing products for durability, repairability, and recyclability. Companies can refurbish used products or components to extend their life cycle. For instance, Canon recycles printer cartridges by reusing plastic and refurbishing components to prevent disposal.
    
5. **Resource Recovery**: The final stage of the product lifecycle, focusing on recycling materials at the end of a product's life. This process can include closed-loop, upcycling, or downcycling methods. However, challenges remain in maintaining the quality of recycled materials.
