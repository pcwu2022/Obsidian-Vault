### Books

1. 1954: *The Practice of Management*
   - Drucker views management as a holistic human practice. His famous assertion is that the primary purpose of a business is to "create a customer." He believes that business organizations serve society by providing products or services that customers value, differentiating this from shareholder- or stakeholder-centered theories.
   - Drucker emphasizes that an organization’s two core functions are marketing (attracting customers) and innovation (improving products/services to maintain customers). If these are neglected, the organization loses its reason to exist.

2. 1967: *The Effective Executive*
   - This book focuses on how managers can be effective. Drucker provides eight actionable recommendations, including asking the right questions, developing action plans, and focusing on opportunities rather than problems. 
   - He outlines three key roles of an executive: 
     - Directing: setting direction through questions and decisions.
     - Managing: aligning activities by planning and running productive meetings.
     - Leading: helping people grow by fostering a community and ensuring effective communication.

3. 1999: *Managing Oneself*
   - Drucker advocates for personal responsibility in managing one's career. He encourages self-reflection by asking key questions like "What are my strengths?" and "What are my values?" 
   - The book emphasizes the importance of finding a role aligned with one’s strengths and values, fostering meaning and contribution. It also stresses maintaining responsible relationships with bosses and coworkers.
