A pivot means fundamentally changing the direction of a business when you realize the current products or services aren't meeting the [[Needs]] of the [[Market]]. The main goal of a pivot is to help a company improve revenue or survive in the market, but the way you pivot your business can make all the difference.

## Lean Startup Pivoting

- The true measure of a runway is how many pivots a startup has left: the number of opportunities it has to make a fundamental change to its business strategy.
- When an entrepreneur has an unclear hypothesis, it’s almost impossible to experience complete failure, and without that failure, there is usually no impetus to embark on the radical change a pivot requires.
- Start now! E.g. if Wealthfront had not launched its first product, the team never would have learned what it needed to know to pivot.
- Low-quality MVPs only work for early adopters. Mainstream customers have a different set of requirements and are much more demanding.
- Optimizing, tuning, and iterating all serve one purpose: Testing a clear hypothesis in the service of the company’s vision.
- A pivot is best understood as a new strategic hypothesis that will require a new minimum viable product to test.

#### Type of Pivots

- **Zoom-in:** A single feature becomes the whole product.
- **Zoom-out:** What was considered the whole product becomes a feature of something much larger.
- **Customer segment:** We have built a product that solves a real problem for real customers, but they are not the customers we originally planned to serve.
- **Customer need:** The problem we were trying to solve turns out to not be very important. However, we discover related problems that are important in the process.
- **Platform:** Change from an application to a platform or vice versa
- **Business architecture:** High margin, low volume versus low margin, high volume. Or B2B versus B2C.
- **Value capture:** How you decide to make money.
- **Engine of growth:** Change in strategy to seek faster, more profitable growth.
- **Channel:** Change your distribution channel.
- **Technology:** Achieve the same solution with a different technology.
