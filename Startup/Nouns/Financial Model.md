A **financial model** is a structured representation of an entity's financial performance, typically built in a spreadsheet or specialized software, to project future financial outcomes and evaluate the impact of different decisions or scenarios. It incorporates key financial [[Metrics]] and assumptions, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
### Key Components of a Financial Model:

1. **Inputs**:
    - Assumptions about revenue growth, costs, capital expenditures, etc.
    - Historical financial data for reference and baseline.
    - Market and economic conditions.

2. **Calculations**:
    - Formulas and logic that transform inputs into outputs.
    - Financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement).
    - Key performance indicators ([[KPI]]s) like [[Gross Margin]], [[EBITDA]], or [[ROI]].
    
3. **Outputs**:
    - Forecasted financial statements.
    - Scenarios (e.g., best-case, worst-case).
    - Visualizations (charts, graphs) for decision-making.

### Common Uses of Financial Models:

1. **Business Planning**:
    - Projecting future revenues and expenses.
    - Assessing profitability and sustainability.
      
2. **Investment Analysis**:
    - Evaluating the feasibility of new projects or investments.
    - Calculating the return on investment (ROI) or net present value ([[NPV]]).
      
3. **Valuation**:
    - Estimating a companyâ€™s value for mergers, acquisitions, or IPOs.
    - Using discounted cash flow (DCF) or comparable company analysis.
      
4. **Budgeting and Forecasting**:
    - Comparing actual performance to projections.
    - Adjusting operational strategies based on variances.
      
5. **Risk Assessment**:
    - Simulating how changes in variables (e.g., interest rates, market demand) impact outcomes.
    - Stress testing financial stability.

### Types of Financial Models:
1. **Three-Statement Model**: Links income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow.
2. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**: Projects cash flows and discounts them to present value.
3. **Merger & [[Acquisition]] (M&A) Model**: Assesses the financial implications of mergers or acquisitions.
4. **[[Budget]] Model**: Focuses on detailed cost and revenue projections for operational planning.
5. **Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis Models**: Evaluates outcomes under varying assumptions.
