Seed funding is the initial capital raised by a [[startup]] to support its early-stage development, allowing the business to begin operations, develop products, and validate its [[Market]] potential. It typically comes from founders, family, friends, angel investors, or early-stage venture capital firms.
### Key Features of Seed Funding
1. Purpose: The primary goal is to help the business get off the ground. This can cover product development, [[Market]] research, initial marketing efforts, and hiring key staff.
2. Amount: Seed funding is usually a smaller investment compared to later rounds, typically ranging from a few thousand to a few million dollars, depending on the nature of the business.
3. Risk Level: Seed funding is considered high-risk, as the [[startup]] is often in the very early stages with little proof of concept or market [[traction]].
4. Equity or Convertible Debt: Investors often receive equity (ownership) in the company or a convertible note, which can later convert into equity in a subsequent funding round.
### Sources of Seed Funding
1. Founders' Savings: Many entrepreneurs fund their startups with personal savings during the seed phase.
2. Family and Friends: Entrepreneurs may also turn to their personal networks for early funding.
3. Angel Investors: Wealthy individuals who provide capital for startups in exchange for equity or debt.
4. Venture Capital ([[VC]]) Firms: Some early-stage VC firms specialize in seed funding, offering larger amounts of capital than angels.
5. Crowdfunding: Some startups use crowdfunding platforms to raise small amounts of money from many backers.

### Why Seed Funding is Important
- Product Development: It allows startups to develop prototypes or minimum viable products (MVPs) that can attract further investment.
- Market Validation: Helps test the product-market fit and gain early [[Customer]] feedback.
- Attracting Talent: Provides the financial resources to hire initial team members.
- Building Credibility: Secures initial external funding that may increase the businessâ€™s credibility and open doors for future investments.
