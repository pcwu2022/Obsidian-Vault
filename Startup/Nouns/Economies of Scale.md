**Economies of scale**, refer to the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their size, output, or scale of operation. As the scale of production increases, the average cost per unit of output decreases.

This concept is fundamental in [[Economics|microeconomics]], [[Strategy|business strategy]], and [[industrial organization]].

### Types of Scale Economies

### 1. Internal Economies of Scale
    
Internal economies arise from within the firm as it grows.
- **Technical Economies**: Large firms can use more efficient and specialized machinery.
		- _Example_: A car manufacturer like [[Toyota]] can afford robotic assembly lines that small producers cannot.
- **Managerial Economies**: Larger firms can hire specialized managers for different functions (marketing, operations, etc.).
- **Financial Economies**: Bigger firms often get loans at lower interest rates due to lower perceived risk.	
- **Marketing Economies**: Costs of marketing per unit drop as a firm advertises over a larger output.	
- **Purchasing Economies**: Buying in bulk reduces the per-unit cost of raw materials.
        
### 2.External Economies of Scale
    
External economies occur due to the growth of the industry or market in which the firm operates, not the firm itself.
- _Example_: A concentration of tech firms in [[Silicon Valley]] leads to shared infrastructure, specialized labor pools, and knowledge spillovers.        

### Diseconomies of Scale

After a certain point, firms may experience **diseconomies of scale**, where the average cost per unit starts increasing as output grows.
- Causes:    
    - Communication breakdowns in large organizations        
    - Bureaucratic inefficiencies        
    - Reduced employee motivation due to impersonal work environments        

### Importance in Strategy and Competition

- **First-mover advantage**: Firms that achieve scale first can price lower and deter new entrants.    
- **Barrier to entry**: High initial fixed costs mean new competitors must operate at a large scale to compete on cost.    
- **Platform businesses**: Many digital platforms (e.g., [[Amazon]], [[Google]]) benefit from scale economies via network effects and data accumulation.
    
### Real-World Examples

- **Amazon**: Uses its large volume to negotiate better logistics and inventory pricing, lowering costs per item.    
- **Costco**: Sells in bulk and passes savings to consumers, benefiting from purchasing and operational economies.    
- **Tesla**: Gained production cost advantages as it scaled Gigafactories for EV battery and car production.

- [[Learning Curve Effect]]: Cost reductions due to operational experience over time.    
- [[Network Effects]]: Value increases as more users join a platform, sometimes intersecting with scale economies.    
- [[Fixed Costs]] and [[Marginal Costs]]: Key to understanding average cost behavior.    
- [[Barriers to Entry]]: Scale economies often contribute to these.
