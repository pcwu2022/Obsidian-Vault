The **income statement** provides a financial overview of a company's ability to generate profits over a specific period. It starts with **revenue**, which reflects the total money a company makes from selling goods or services. This is crucial because it represents the company’s primary source of income.

From the revenue, companies subtract **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**, which includes the direct expenses tied to production. The result is the **gross profit**, which shows how much profit is made after covering production costs.

Next, companies subtract **operating expenses**—costs involved in the daily running of the business, such as marketing, salaries, and rent. This gives **operating income**, a key measure of profitability from core activities. It excludes one-off or non-core costs, making it a useful gauge of business efficiency.

**Non-operating items** like interest expenses, gains, or losses from investments are then considered. These items are not directly related to the core business but can impact overall profitability. After accounting for these, you get **pre-tax income**.

The final part is the **income tax expense**, which reduces pre-tax income to arrive at **net income** (or **net profit**), the final bottom line that indicates the company’s overall profitability after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted.
