## Deliver Values
**Value is abstract, and companies cannot deliver abstractness**

> **Question:** _“What does it mean to deliver value?”_

To deliver value informally means to provide something beneficial, helpful, or desirable to someone else.

In this colloquial sense, examples of delivering value are solving a problem, fulfilling a need, satisfying a want, creating an opportunity, or enhancing an experience.

From a methodological perspective, there is no such thing as to “deliver value”.

Companies deliver products, e.g., goods and services, to the [[Market]]. Products are relatively objective, with functionality and purpose that can be readily understood.

However, value is a highly abstract concept. Companies cannot deliver abstractness.

Amorphous ideas, such as value, status, prestige, satisfaction, and disappointment, intrinsically occur in the market and cannot be produced and delivered.

In the _Blackblot PMTK Methodology™_, [Value](https://www.blackblot.com/glossary) is defined as worth derived by the customer from owning and using the product.

So the phrase to “deliver value” can be considered meaningless because value is subjective and context-dependent and can vary depending on an individual’s [[Needs]], preferences, and expectations.

Value can mean different things to stakeholders, such as customers, employees, shareholders, or society.

Therefore, delivering value is not a specific or actionable goal. Instead, it is a vague and generic statement that does not communicate concrete benefits or outcomes.

A more effective way to communicate in business is to use specific and measurable terms that describe what value means for each [[Stakeholder]] and how it will be delivered.

The better way is to use the concept of **Value Proposition**.

A value proposition is a clear statement that summarizes why a customer should buy the product.

The value proposition describes how the product solves the user’s or customer’s problem or improves their situation, what specific positive outcomes (**Resultant Value Proposition**) they can expect from using the product, and why they should choose the product over the competition (**Competitive Advantage**).
## Company Core Values
As a definition, company core values are the clearly stated principles about the organization’s vision, mission, and principles. That way, everyone is aligned around a guiding philosophy to serve employees, customers, and the broader community.

That can also double as the definition of company [[Culture]]. In many ways, _values_ and _culture_ are synonymous. They’re both about the higher aspirations of a company. The result is the DNA fundamental to a company’s identity. 

Ensuring that everyone understands those ambitions requires great internal communication. The trouble is too many companies assume the workforce knows what’s most important. (After all, it’s a plaque in the lobby next to the elevators!) But because there’s a statement on a wall, website, or handbook doesn’t mean employees get the message.  

What’s needed is a clear, steady cadence of information that reinforces those principles. Let’s take a closer look into ways that organizations can thrive through communicating their core values.
