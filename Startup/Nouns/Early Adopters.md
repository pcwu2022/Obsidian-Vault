**Early adopters** are the first segment of users to embrace a new product, service, or technology. 

1. **Visionaries and Risk-Takers**:  
    They are open to trying unproven solutions because they value innovation and are willing to take risks.
    
2. **Problem-Sensitive**:  
    Early adopters have a strong need or problem that the product addresses. They are actively seeking a solution and willing to experiment.
    
3. **Influencers**:  
    They often have credibility in their communities and can influence others to adopt a product if it proves valuable.
    
4. **Tolerant of Imperfections**:  
    Early adopters are forgiving of bugs or incomplete features because they understand that the product is in its early stages.
    
5. **Feedback-Oriented**:  
    They provide detailed and constructive feedback, helping teams refine the product.
    
6. **Motivated by Benefits**:
