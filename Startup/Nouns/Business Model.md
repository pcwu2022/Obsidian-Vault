> Business Model: Creating, Delivering, and Capturing Value

### Key Elements of a Business Model

1. **[[Create Value]]**: This involves identifying customer needs or pain points and designing products or services that fulfill these needs better than existing alternatives. For example, a company may innovate by introducing new technologies or improving on existing ones.
    
2. **Deliver Value**: This refers to how a company gets its products or services to customers. It involves distribution channels, customer service, partnerships, and any other means of making sure the value reaches the target market.
    
3. **Capture Value**: This is the method by which a business earns revenue. It includes pricing strategies, sales models (such as subscriptions or one-time purchases), and the ways the company ensures it can generate profit from its offerings.

### Why Design a Business Model?

The way a product is marketed, priced, and who the customer is, can dramatically impact its success. This is why business model design is crucial. Different strategies will lead to varying levels of customer satisfaction, revenue generation, and business scalability.

### Business Model Examples

1. **Philips - Lighting as a Service**  
    Philips shifted from selling lighting products to offering lighting as a service. This addresses the pain point of sustainability and product disposal. Customers pay Philips for lighting needs, while Philips manages the maintenance and recycling, ensuring a longer lifecycle for the products and greater customer loyalty. 
    
2. **Adobe Creative Cloud - Transition to a [[Subscription]] Model**  
    Adobe transitioned from perpetual licensing to a **[[SaaS]]** model with Creative Cloud. This allowed Adobe to offer continuous updates and cloud-based services. Its offerings now include Experience Cloud, Document Cloud, and integrations like **Adobe Sensei** for AI-driven automation. This model has created a strong ecosystem and community, enhanced by acquisitions like Magento and Marketo.
    
3. **Nespresso - Integrated System and Subscription**  
    Nespresso has created a **vertically integrated system** where it manufactures both machines and capsules. This closed ecosystem locks customers into using Nespresso products. It also offers **[[subscription]] services**, helping retain customers by ensuring they never run out of coffee. Nespressoâ€™s premium positioning, direct-to-consumer channels, and sustainability initiatives have cemented its reputation as a luxury brand.
    
4. **Google/Facebook - Free Business Models**  
    Both companies offer **ad-driven revenue models**. They provide free services to users (Google Search, Gmail, Facebook), while generating revenue through targeted ads. By collecting and monetizing user data, they ensure highly personalized ads. These platforms expand their ecosystems by providing free tools, driving engagement, and generating more ad impressions.
    
5. **Netflix - Subscription-Based Streaming**  
    Netflix employs a **[[subscription]]-based model**, offering access to a vast content library. They invest heavily in **Netflix Originals**, reducing reliance on third-party content and differentiating from competitors. Netflix uses **data-driven recommendations**, personalization, and **[[AB Testing]]** to improve user engagement and retention. The company's reliance on data improves as their user base grows, creating a **flywheel effect**.
