有可以改變世界的磁場
[[Steve Jobs]]

The reality distortion field is a strong will and the ability to bend any reality to fit the desired purpose. Reality is malleable in the presence of this power. [[Steve Jobs]], through his RDF, can convince anybody of anything. It seems to be working even when somebody is not aware of it. Your reality distortion field defines who you are, your strengths, weaknesses, abilities, limitations, and more. 

What you perceive of yourself and exhibit to the world becomes the reality that others are convinced of. For example, if you are nervous speaking in public, everybody else picks it up and you project your unpolished skills as a reality. If you believe you are not good to people and keep sitting in a corner at parties, you never get a chance to improve and your poor socialization skill becomes the reality. 

The same thing happens when you perceive yourself as powerful and skilled. If you believe you are a strong leader, you grab the opportunity to lead and your leadership becomes the reality. The best aspect of the RDF is that it can be changed. By changing what you think of yourself, you can change the reality around you. Start thinking you are a business person if you want to become a successful entrepreneur.  

## How To Create A Reality Distortion Field? 

Activating your reality distortion field involves two steps:

1. **Accepting the importance of perception**

	The first step in creating your RDF is to realize that your perception of events is more important than the events themselves. Believing that your positive thoughts can overpower the reality existing outside is the core concept of RDF. Practice this idea by asking yourself what problems can get solved by changing how you think about them or what conflicts can improve by looking at them from another point of view. 

2. **Using your thoughts to shape reality**

	The wisdom of influential leaders provides the key to changing the circumstances with thoughts. You are what you think and you remain what you continue thinking. You can change what and where you are by changing your thoughts. To apply this truth, ask yourself whether your inner self is consistent with the desired reality and whether you are creating undesirable situations with your thoughts.
