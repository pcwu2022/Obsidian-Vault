### The Four Growth Strategies of the Ansoff Matrix:

1. **Market Penetration** (Existing Products, Existing Markets)
   - **Objective**: Increase market share within existing markets using existing products.
   - **Tactics**: Enhancing product features, increasing marketing efforts, lowering prices, or improving customer service.
   - **Example**: Coca-Cola increasing its market share by offering promotions and advertisements to attract more customers in a region where it is already present.

2. **Product Development** (New Products, Existing Markets)
   - **Objective**: Develop new products to sell to the existing customer base.
   - **Tactics**: Innovation, launching new variations or versions of current products, and improving product offerings.
   - **Example**: Apple launching new iPhone models with improved features for its existing customers.

3. **Market Development** (Existing Products, New Markets)
   - **Objective**: Enter new markets with existing products.
   - **Tactics**: Expanding geographically, targeting different customer segments, or finding new distribution channels.
   - **Example**: McDonald's entering new countries and regions with its existing menu offerings.

4. **Diversification** (New Products, New Markets)
   - **Objective**: Develop new products and enter new markets simultaneously.
   - **Tactics**: Creating entirely new product lines or venturing into new industries, often involving higher risk but the potential for significant reward.
   - **Example**: Google diversifying from a search engine to various other services and products, like Google Cloud, smartphones, and autonomous vehicles.
