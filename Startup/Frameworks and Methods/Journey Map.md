A **journey map** is a visual representation that illustrates the steps a customer takes when interacting with a brand, product, or service. It outlines the entire experience, from the first point of contact to the post-purchase phase, and identifies key touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and opportunities for improvement along the way. Journey maps are commonly used in user experience (UX) design, marketing, and customer service to understand and optimize the customer experience.

### Key Elements of a Journey Map:
1. **Stages**: The different phases the customer goes through, such as awareness, consideration, purchase, and post-purchase.
2. **Touchpoints**: The points of interaction between the customer and the brand, like websites, social media, customer service, or in-store experiences.
3. **Customer Actions**: The specific actions the customer takes at each stage (e.g., browsing, buying, sharing).
4. **Emotions**: The feelings or emotional states the customer experiences during each stage of the journey (e.g., frustration, excitement, satisfaction).
5. **Pain Points**: Areas where the customer faces challenges, frustrations, or obstacles.
6. **Opportunities**: Insights that can help improve the customer experience and address pain points.
