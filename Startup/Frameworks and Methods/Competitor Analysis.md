## 1. Identify your competitors

To create a list of potential competitors, consider where your customers would turn if they didn’t buy from your company. 
### Methods: 
1. search your product name or category on Google 
2. Survey or interview existing customers 

When analyzing competitors, businesses typically categorize them into three main types: **direct competitors**, **indirect competitors**, and **replacement competitors**. Each type of competitor affects your business differently and requires distinct strategies to address.

### Types of Competitors

| **Competitor Type**         | **Description**                                     | **Example**                         | **Strategy to Address**                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct Competitors**      | Offer similar products/services to the same market. | Two burger chains in the same city. | Differentiate with quality, pricing, customer experience, or unique features.           |
| **Indirect Competitors**    | Provide different products that meet the same need. | Burger vs. pizza restaurants.       | Expand offerings or highlight unique selling points to retain customer interest.        |
| **Replacement Competitors** | Offer alternatives or make the product obsolete.    | Burger vs. home-cooked meal kits.   | Innovate to align with trends or focus on marketing convenience and value propositions. |

## 2. Create a competitor matrix
A competitor matrix, also known as a competitor grid, is a table or spreadsheet you can use to compile your research. This will make it easier to compare your findings across competitors and spot larger trends.

|**Attribute**|**Your Coffee Shop**|**Competitor A** (Large Chain)|**Competitor B** (Local Café)|**Competitor C** (Online Subscription)**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Pricing**|$$|$|$$|$$$|
|**Quality**|High|Medium|High|Very High|
|**Product Range**|Moderate|Wide|Limited|Moderate|
|**Customer Service**|Excellent|Good|Excellent|Moderate|
|**Convenience**|Moderate|High|Low|Very High (home delivery)|

## 3. Gather background information

### Company history
This includes information such as founding date, funding sources, and any mergers or acquisitions they have been involved with. Studying how your competitors got to where they are today will give you a more complete understanding of their businesses.

### Location
If you’re in the e-commerce business, you could be competing against companies that sell their products worldwide. For traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, your competition is likely highly localized.

### Company size
How many people do your competitors employ? LinkedIn and Glassdoor are helpful resources for this kind of data. You’ll also want to look into how many customers your competitors have and how much revenue they generate. 

## 4. Profile your competition’s target customers
Getting an idea of who your competitors sell to will tell you a lot about their businesses. To pinpoint the target customer for any business:

1. Read their mission statement.
2. Look at what kind of messaging they use.
3. Track who they interact with on social media.
4. See if they feature any existing customers in their content.

Use this information to construct a profile of who your competitors are trying to reach with their products or services. These customer profiles will probably resemble your own target customers—these are your competitors, after all—so make note of even small differences.

### Product
1. What are they selling?
2. What features are included in their product or service?
3. What is most appealing to customers about the product or service? What are some weak points of the product or service? (Pro tip: Check out customer reviews.)
### Price
1. What kind of pricing model do they use? Is it a one-time purchase or a subscription?
2. How much do they charge for their product or service? Do they offer sales or discounts?
3. How does their pricing reflect the quality, or perceived quality, of their product or service?
### Promotion
1. How do they get the word out about their product or service? What advertising channels do they use?
2. What elements of their product or service do they emphasize? What’s their unique selling proposition?
3. What’s their company story? How do they talk about their brand?
### Place
1. Where do they sell their product? 
2. Do they sell online or in brick-and-mortar locations?
3. Do they sell to customers directly, or do they partner with retailers or third-party marketplaces?

## 6. Analyze [[SWOT|strengths and weaknesses]]—yours and your competitors’
Using the information you’ve collected, consider the strengths and weaknesses of each of your selected competitors. Last, consider your own company’s strengths and weaknesses. How does your business compare to the competitors you’ve researched?
