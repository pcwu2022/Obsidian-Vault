**STP Framework in Business and Marketing**

STP (Segmentation, Targeting, and [[Positioning]]) is a strategic model used in business and marketing to effectively identify and serve specific [[Market]] segments by tailoring marketing efforts to meet the unique needs of distinct consumer groups. This approach allows businesses to refine their strategies and allocate resources to maximize market impact. Below is a summary of each component:

### 1. [[Segmentation]]
Segmentation is about dividing a larger market into smaller, well-defined groups based on shared characteristics, allowing businesses to target consumers more effectively.

- **Example**: In education, parents pay for children’s education until around 18, whereas adult education funding often comes from the individual.
- **High Care Needs**: Older adults, especially those from pre-WWII generations, may resist spending on care, creating financial stress for the "sandwich generation" responsible for their support.

Segmentation criteria can include:
  - **Demographic**: Age, income, gender.
  - **Psychographic**: Interests, values.
  - **Behavioral**: Buying habits, brand loyalty.

### 2. Targeting
Targeting involves selecting specific segments identified in segmentation to focus on. Businesses choose segments based on attractiveness factors like size, growth, and alignment with business resources.

- **Example**: In the healthcare sector, hospitals focus on medical treatment, while home care providers focus on daily living support.

### 3. [[Positioning]]
[[Positioning]] defines how a product or service is perceived in the target market. It’s about creating a unique brand image that highlights distinct benefits or features to make it appealing to the targeted segment.

[[Positioning]] components include:
  - **Value Proposition**: The product’s unique appeal to the target.
  - **Differentiation**: How it stands out from competitors.
  - **[[Positioning]] Statement**: A statement that summarizes the product’s key benefits and its target market.

### Example of STP Application: 
A sports brand could:
- **Segment** by demographics (age, income) and psychographics (active lifestyle).
- **Target** young, fitness-oriented consumers.
- **Position** itself as a high-quality brand for those who value both style and performance.

Through STP, businesses can communicate more relevant messages, build strong brand identities, and better satisfy customers by addressing their specific needs.
