## The Highest Paid Person’s Opinion

The HiPPO is an old management style where the most senior person in the room is seen as the expert. The HiPPO is assumed to have the best understanding of the situation and so their opinion is prioritized over others.

This may be the result of the HiPPO having more conviction, organizational knowledge, or working longer hours. Regardless of the cause, it results in one individuals opinions carrying considerably more weight than others.

## The problem with the HiPPO effect

Companies need to find the ideas that are likely to have the biggest positive impact on team objectives and KPIs. It doesn’t matter where ideas come from (a designer, an engineer, the CEO or the office cleaner), all ideas should be considered and prioritized equally and considered purely based on their ability to [[Influence]] team objectives.

No member of a growth team, no matter how senior or experienced, can predict which ideas will work and which won’t – there are just too many unknowns.

In short, the HiPPO is a dangerous animal in the world of growth.

A HiPPO mentality introduces gut feelings and emotion into this process and reduces the likelihood of the team working on the most impactful opportunities. Where companies have traditionally used opinions and archaic decision-making processes to place bets on a handful of unproven ideas, growth marketers are now adopting more quantitative scoring models.

## How to remove the HiPPO effect?

Good growth marketers, and growth marketing teams, default to using data rather than [[Intuition]] and opinion where possible.

[[Prioritization Frameworks]] ensure growth marketing teams avoid the HiPPO [[Culture]] and are more intentional and intelligent about their efforts. The common scoring language removes subjectivity when evaluating marketing ideas. The end result is an unambiguous, prioritized todo list for your marketing or growth team.

In addition to preventing HiPPO culture, using a prioritization framework forces the growth team to be honest, and avoid human nature where people tend to:

1. Overestimate the probability of success
2. Inflate the impact of recent work
3. Underestimate the amount of effort required to implement something

It also encourages the team to think about ideas ahead of time, and removes gut feelings and emotion from the process.
