The core elements of BRASS framework are outlined below.

| Factor           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **B**link        | Your intuitive score for the idea. Whatâ€™s your initial gut feeling?                                                                                                 |
| **R**elevance    | How relevant is this channel for me? Do I have product-channel fit? How narrowly can you target and reach your potential [[Customer]]s using this technique?        |
| **A**vailability | Do I have resources in-house to do this? How easy is it to set up this channel? How long will it take? How much will it cost? Do we already have some of the tools? |
| **S**calability  | If it turns out to be extremely effective, how easy will it be to scale it up?                                                                                      |
| **S**core        | N/A                                                                                                                                                                 |

Assign a score between 1 and 5 for each of the 4 factors above (Blink, Relevance, Availability and Scalability) where 1 is the lowest and worst score, and 5 is the highest and the best. These are then used to calculate your overall score. Whilst BRASS prioritization can be performed by an individual it is best done as a team where possible.
