HIPE is a list 4 factors, as opposed to a more rigid formula like [[PXL Framework]]. Below are the core questions from the framework as well as other questions to consider based on [Jeff Chang’s original article](https://www.growthengblog.com/blog/2018/6/11/the-4-most-important-factors-when-evaluating-growth-opportunities).

|Factor|Question|Considerations|
|---|---|---|
|Hypothesis|Why will this idea have a significant impact on [[Metrics]]?|Opportunity size / affected users?  <br>Increasing intent or decreasing friction?|
|Investment|How much time will we have to invest in this project?|Time to develop/implement?  <br>Time to maintain?|
|Precedent|Is there a precedent for this working in the past?|Relevant past experiment?  <br>Note: avoid industry benchmarks where possible|
|Experience|Is this change a good user experience?|How does this impact longer-term quality metrics?|
