[[Startup]] funding rounds are critical phases in a company’s journey where it raises capital from investors. Each round reflects a different stage of growth, with unique goals, challenges, and expectations. Here’s a deeper look at each phase:

### 1. Pre-seed Funding
- Stage: Idea or very early-stage development.
- Goal: Validate the idea, develop a prototype or [[MVP]] (Minimum Viable Product), and perform initial market research.
- Investors: Often comes from the founders' personal savings, family, friends, or angel investors.
- Amount Raised: Typically ranges from $10,000 to $500,000, depending on the nature of the startup.
- Valuation: Low, as the startup usually doesn't have a product or users yet. The focus is on the potential of the idea.
- Key Objective: Validate whether the idea can be turned into a viable business.

### 2. [[Seed Funding]]
- Stage: Early-stage development after the [[MVP]] or product prototype is built.
- Goal: Build the product, gain some initial market [[Traction]], and start assembling a core team.
- Investors: Early-stage VCs, angel investors, or seed funds. Sometimes crowdfunding platforms are also used.
- Amount Raised: Typically ranges from $500,000 to $2 million, though amounts can vary widely depending on industry and geography.
- Valuation: Typically between $3 million to $6 million.
- Key Objective: Achieve "product-market fit"—prove that the product has a real customer base and that there is a market for it.

### 3. Series A
- Stage: The product has been developed, and the company has achieved some level of market validation.
- Goal: Scale the business by improving the product, expanding the team, and growing the user base.
- Investors: Institutional venture capitalists (VCs) specializing in early-stage startups. This round is more formal, with VCs expecting a clear [[Business Model]] and a path to profitability.
- Amount Raised: Typically ranges from $2 million to $15 million, depending on the company’s potential.
- Valuation: Usually between $10 million and $30 million, though it can vary based on the company’s market, [[Traction]], and industry.
- Key Objective: Grow revenue and establish a scalable [[Business Model]].

### 4. Series B
- Stage: The company has established itself, has a sizable user base, and is generating revenue.
- Goal: Expand the business, whether through entering new markets, scaling operations, or launching new product lines.
- Investors: Larger VCs and institutional investors. These investors expect higher levels of proof, such as sustained growth, clear unit economics, and solid market share.
- Amount Raised: Typically between $10 million and $50 million.
- Valuation: Between $30 million and $60 million, depending on the company's performance and growth potential.
- Key Objective: Scale operations, expand market reach, and prepare the company for significant growth.

### 5. Series C and Beyond
- Stage: The company is well-established, generating significant revenue, and may be preparing for an [[IPO]] or [[Acquisition]].
- Goal: Further expand the company, often through international expansion, acquisitions, or product diversification.
- Investors: Late-stage VCs, private equity firms, hedge funds, and sometimes strategic investors looking for long-term growth opportunities.
- Amount Raised: Ranges from $50 million to hundreds of millions, depending on the company's size and market potential.
- Valuation: Companies at this stage may be valued at $100 million to over $1 billion (the so-called "unicorn" status for companies valued at $1 billion or more).
- Key Objective: Position the company for a major exit, such as an [[IPO]] or acquisition.

### 6. Series D, E, etc.
- Stage: Reserved for companies needing additional funding to achieve their goals, usually after Series C.
- Goal: Some companies raise additional rounds to fuel further growth, while others might raise these rounds to correct challenges in earlier stages (e.g., if the company has grown but is not yet profitable).
- Investors: A mix of previous investors and new participants, sometimes including more traditional investors like banks or sovereign wealth funds.
- Amount Raised: Variable but can be in the range of $100 million to several billion dollars.
- Valuation: High, often in the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.
- Key Objective: Either scale further or correct course to ensure long-term viability.

### Bridge Rounds (Convertible Notes or SAFE)
Bridge rounds are often used between larger funding rounds to keep the company moving forward. These rounds can take the form of convertible notes or SAFEs (Simple Agreement for Future Equity).

- Convertible Notes: A loan that converts into equity at a future date, typically during the next funding round.
- SAFE: An agreement for investors to receive shares in a future round, usually on better terms than the next round’s investors.

### 7. [[IPO]] (Initial Public Offering)
- Stage: The company is mature, with proven revenue, profitability (or at least a path to profitability), and significant market presence.
- Goal: Raise large amounts of capital by offering shares to the public on a stock exchange. IPOs allow the company to access public markets for funding and provide liquidity to early investors.
- Investors: Public investors (institutional and retail), underwritten by investment banks.
- Amount Raised: Can range from hundreds of millions to several billion dollars.
- Valuation: The company is valued through a process involving underwriters, typically based on revenue, market potential, and growth prospects.
- Key Objective: Gain public investment, provide liquidity for early investors, and access long-term growth capital.

### Common Terminology in Startup Funding:
- Equity: The ownership stake investors receive in return for their investment.
- Valuation: The estimated worth of a company at a given time.
- Dilution: When a company issues new shares, the ownership percentage of existing shareholders is reduced.
- Cap Table (Capitalization Table): A document that outlines the ownership structure of the company, showing investors' stakes and founders' equity.

### How Funding Impacts the Startup
Each funding round involves giving up a portion of the company's equity in exchange for capital. Early-stage rounds (Pre-seed, Seed, Series A) typically involve higher dilution because the company is riskier. As the startup grows and proves its [[Business Model]], it can negotiate better terms, but will still need to balance growth with how much ownership is given up.
