Porter’s Five Forces is a framework for ==analyzing the competitive forces that shape an industry==. 

1. **Threat of New Entrants**: The ease or difficulty with which new competitors can enter the industry and challenge established companies. Factors like capital requirements, [[brand]] loyalty, and economies of scale influence this force.
   
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: The power suppliers have in influencing the price of inputs. If there are few suppliers or if they offer unique products, they can charge higher prices and influence the industry’s cost structure.
   
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: The influence customers have over the [[Pricing]] and terms of products and services. If customers can easily switch between competitors, their bargaining power increases.
   
4. **Threat of Substitute Products or Services**: The likelihood that customers will switch to alternative products or services. When substitutes are readily available and affordable, the threat is higher.
   
5. **Industry Rivalry**: The intensity of competition between existing players in the market. High rivalry can reduce profits as companies compete on price, quality, or innovation.

### Example: smartphone industry:

1. **Threat of New Entrants**:
    
    - **Low**: The smartphone industry has high entry barriers, including significant capital investment, established brand loyalty, and technological expertise. Companies like Apple and Samsung dominate the market, making it difficult for new entrants to compete.
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**:
    
    - **Medium**: While there are many suppliers of smartphone components (e.g., chips, screens, batteries), key suppliers like Qualcomm and TSMC hold significant power due to their specialized products and limited competition. However, the large scale of smartphone companies can give them negotiating power.
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**:
    
    - **High**: Consumers have a wide variety of options in terms of smartphone brands and features, making their bargaining power strong. The availability of alternatives, from budget phones to premium models, gives customers the ability to compare prices and choose based on preferences.
4. **Threat of Substitute Products**:
    
    - **Medium**: While other electronics, such as tablets or wearables, can partially substitute smartphones, they do not offer the same all-in-one functionality (e.g., calling, messaging, apps). However, advances in technology like foldable screens may blur these lines.
5. **Industry Rivalry**:
    
    - **High**: The smartphone market is highly competitive, with numerous companies, including Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, and Huawei, constantly innovating and vying for market share. This intense rivalry drives innovation but also leads to price wars and frequent product updates.
