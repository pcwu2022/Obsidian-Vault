The **Lean Canvas** was adapted from the [[Business Model Canvas]] to focus more on early-stage startups and their key assumptions. 
### Key Sections of the Lean Canvas

1. **Problem**:
   - [[What's Your Problem|Identify the top 1–3 problems]] that your target customers face.
   - You want to validate whether these problems are real and significant enough to build a business around.
   - 客戶不在乎有甚麼 SPEC，而是[[Pain Point|痛點]]有沒有夠痛，有沒有其他替代方案？

2. **Customer Segments**:
   - Who are the different [[Segmentation|customer groups]] you are targeting? 
   - These could include different demographics, job roles, or behavioral segments.
   - This section also includes the **early adopters** — the first people who will use your product or service.
