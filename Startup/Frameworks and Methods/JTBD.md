JTBD (Jobs to Be Done) is a framework that focuses on understanding customer needs by identifying the "job" a customer is trying to accomplish when they use a product or service. Rather than simply focusing on demographics or traditional [[Segmentation]], JTBD looks at the underlying motivations and tasks that drive customer behavior. The goal is to design or improve a product by addressing these core motivations effectively.

### Key Concepts in JTBD:
1. Job: The task or outcome that a customer aims to achieve.
2. Progress: The improvement or transformation a customer seeks through a solution.
3. Context: The specific situation in which the customer seeks to complete the job.
4. Solutions: Products or services that customers "hire" to get their job done.

## Example

When Apple announced record sales of $54.5 billion, critics were still unimpressed, questioning if innovation had peaked since [[Steve Jobs]]. Many pointed to the iPhone 5, noting it wasn’t a drastic departure from previous models.

- Users “hire” Apple products to streamline their digital lives with sleek, reliable devices.
- They want cutting-edge tech that’s easy to use.
- Customers need their gadgets to sync effortlessly, creating a cohesive experience.

Apple’s main selling point is their eco-system. Your iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and Apple Watch all work together smoothly, and they constantly making iterations to their products by adding meaningful features without unnecessary extras.

### How Startups Can Use JTBD:
1. Identify Core Jobs: Understand what key "jobs" customers need to get done that align with your product.
2. Focus on Outcomes: Design the product to meet specific customer outcomes and make the process simpler or more efficient.
3. Differentiate: Use JTBD insights to highlight what uniquely qualifies your product to fulfill these jobs better than competitors.
4. Test and Iterate: Continuously get customer feedback to ensure your product remains aligned with evolving jobs.
