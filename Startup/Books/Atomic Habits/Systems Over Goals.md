The concept of "Systems Over Goals" in _Atomic Habits_ emphasizes that sustainable success comes from focusing on systems rather than just setting goals. While goals define the outcome you want, systems determine the process that leads to that outcome.

### Why Systems Matter More Than Goals

- **Goals are temporary; systems create lasting change.**
    - Example: A runner with the goal of completing a marathon may stop training afterward, but a runner with a consistent training system stays fit for life.
- **Goals rely on motivation; systems rely on consistency.**
    - Example: Instead of aiming to "write a book," having a daily writing habit ensures steady progress.
- **Goals can create a yo-yo effect; systems build identity.**
    - Example: Someone who focuses on dieting to lose weight may regain it after reaching their goal, while someone who builds a healthy eating system sustains long-term well-being.

### How to Build Effective Systems

1. **Focus on the process, not the outcome.**
    - Example: Instead of setting a goal to read 50 books, establish a habit of reading 20 minutes daily.
2. **Make small, consistent improvements.**
    - Example: Aim for 1% improvement each day rather than big, unsustainable changes.
3. **Align systems with identity.**
    - Example: "I am a healthy eater" leads to sustainable habits, while "I want to lose weight" is short-term.
