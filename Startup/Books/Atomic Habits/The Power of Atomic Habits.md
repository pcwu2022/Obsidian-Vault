James Clear’s _Atomic Habits_ emphasizes the power of small, consistent changes in shaping our lives. Rather than relying on drastic transformations, the book argues that minor improvements, when compounded over time, lead to remarkable progress.

### The 1% Rule

- A 1% improvement each day leads to exponential growth over time.
- Small habits accumulate into significant changes, whether positive or negative.
- Instead of focusing on immediate results, prioritize long-term consistency.

### [[Systems Over Goals]]

- Goals set a direction, but systems create progress.
- Focusing on identity and processes ensures sustainable improvement.
- Successful individuals don't just have goals—they create systems that support continuous growth.

### The Compound Effect of Habits

- Similar to compound interest in finance, habits build up gradually but yield substantial results.
- Good habits provide an upward trajectory, while bad habits lead to decline.
- Immediate gratification often prevents us from seeing the long-term benefits of small, positive actions.

### Identity-Based Change

- Behavior change is most effective when tied to identity, not just outcomes.
- Instead of saying "I want to run a marathon," say "I am a runner."
- Each action taken reinforces a sense of identity, making the habit stick.
