Breaking bad habits requires reversing the Four Laws of Behavior Change from _Atomic Habits_. By making bad habits invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying, we can effectively reduce their [[influence]].

### 1. Make It Invisible

- Remove cues that trigger the bad habit.
- Example: If you want to stop snacking, keep unhealthy food out of sight or remove it from your home entirely.
- Reduce exposure to environments that reinforce the habit.

### 2. Make It Unattractive

- Reframe your mindset about the bad habit.
- Example: Instead of thinking "I need a cigarette to relax," focus on how smoking damages your health.
- Associate bad habits with negative consequences.

### 3. Make It Difficult

- Increase the effort required to perform the habit.
- Example: Delete social media apps from your phone to reduce mindless scrolling.
- Use a commitment device to add friction, such as a locked savings account to prevent unnecessary spending.

### 4. Make It Unsatisfying

- Introduce immediate consequences for engaging in the bad habit.
- Example: Use an accountability partner who will call you out if you break your commitment.
- Track failures to create awareness of habit patterns.
