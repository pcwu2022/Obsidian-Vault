Anyone can steer the sip, but it takes a leader the chart the course.

> Controlling your direction is better than being controlled by it.
> A leader is one who sees more than  others see, who sees farther than others see, and who sees before others do.
> If a leader can't navigate the people through rough waters, he is liable to sink the ship.
> Major barriers to successful planning are :
> 	1. fear of change
> 	2. ignorance
> 	3. uncertainty about the future
> 	4. lack of imagination

The secret is preparation

- Navigators draw on past experience
- Navigators listen to what others have to say
- Navigators examine the conditions before making commitments
- Navigators make sure their conclusions represent both faith and fact

> It's not the size of the project that determines its acceptance, support and success, It's the size of the leader.
