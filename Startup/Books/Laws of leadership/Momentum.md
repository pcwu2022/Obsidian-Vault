**Momentum is a leader's best friend.**

> "When you have momentum, you look better than you actually are. When you donâ€™t have it, you appear worse than you are."

Momentum makes a leader's job easier because it amplifies everything the leader does. When momentum is strong, even small efforts or decisions can lead to significant results, whereas in its absence, even large efforts may struggle to gain traction.

> "If you can create momentum, you can move mountains."

Without momentum, even the simplest tasks can seem insurmountable. But with momentum, a leader can turn small wins into larger successes, creating a compounding effect.

### Key Principles of the Law of Momentum

1. **Momentum begins with the leader**: Leaders are responsible for generating momentum. They must take the initiative to create movement and excitement around their vision.
2. **Momentum makes a leader better**: With momentum, everything a leader does is magnified in terms of effectiveness. Followers become more enthusiastic, and the entire team gains confidence.
3. **Momentum helps overcome obstacles**: Challenges that once seemed overwhelming can be easily overcome when momentum is in place.
4. **Momentum is the great exaggerator**: When you have momentum, your efforts seem more effective than they might otherwise be, and people are more willing to follow you.
5. **Momentum is easier to steer than to start**: Once momentum is created, it's easier to maintain and steer it in the desired direction. But creating it from a standstill requires significant energy and focus.

### Examples of Success

- **Walt Disney**: Overcame numerous setbacks to create a media empire, constantly building momentum by turning small successes into major achievements.
- **Martin Luther King Jr.**: Generated immense momentum for the civil rights movement, using small victories to fuel larger societal changes.

Momentum can often be the difference between success and failure, as it powers leaders and their teams through tough times and amplifies positive progress.
