When the real leader speaks, people listen

> The real leader holds the power, not just the position.
> Being in power is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren't .
> If you see a disparity between who's leading the people. then the person running the meeting is not the real leader.

### Positional Leaders vs. Real Leaders

| Positional Leaders                          | Real Leaders                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Speak first                                 | Speak later                    |
| Need the [[Influence]] of the real leader       | Need only their own influence  |
| Influence only the other positional leaders | Influence everyone in the room |

> The real test of leadership isn't where you start out. It's where you end up.
> The proof of leadership is found in the followers.

### How people become real leaders

1. Character - who they are
2. Relationships- who they know
3. Knowledge - what they know
4. [[Intuition]] - what they feel
5. Experience - Where they've been
6. Past success - what they've done
7. Ability - what they can do

> People listen not necessarily because of the truth being communicated in the message, but because of their respect for the speaker.
