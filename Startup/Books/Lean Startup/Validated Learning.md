### Concepts of Learning

- Customers do not tell us what they want. They reveal the truth through their action or inaction.
- Any action that does not contribute to learning about what creates value for customers is a form of waste.
- Can you validate your hypothesis without building anything? Run an experiment and measure customer behavior.
- The question is not, “Can this product be built?” The better questions are: 
	- “Should this product be built?”
	- “Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services?”

### Experiment

- Don’t follow the “Just do it” line of thinking. You will not gain validated learning this way. **If you cannot fail, you cannot learn.**
- Test a small idea to answer a big question.
    - E.g. Zappos took pictures of another store’s inventory and sold shoes on their website to test the assumption that there was a demand for buying shoes online.
- Find [[Early Adopters]]: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.
- An experiment is more than just a theoretical inquiry; it is also a first product.
- Success is not delivering features; success is learning how to solve the customer’s problem.
- Planning is a tool that only works in the presence of a long and stable operating history.

#### The 2 Most Important Assumptions Entrepreneurs Make

1. **[[Value Hypothesis]]:** Does a product or service really deliver value to customers once they are using it? Design experiments that prove this by their actions. Don’t use surveys.
2. **[[Growth Hypothesis]]:** How will new customers discover a product or service?

#### 4 Questions For Product Development

1. Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?
2. If there was a solution, would they buy it?
3. Would they buy it from us?
4. Can we build a solution for that problem?

### Steer: Cycle Through the [[Build-Measure-Learn]] Feedback Loop

- The products a startup builds are really experiments; the learning about how to build a sustainable business is the outcome of those experiments.
- Focus our energy on minimizing the _total time_ through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop.
- Test the most important assumptions ([[Value Hypothesis]] and [[Growth Hypothesis]]) first with a [[MVP]].
- The MVP is the version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with the least amount of time and effort.
- If we’re building something that nobody wants, it doesn’t much matter if we’re doing it on time and on budget.

### Leap: Strategy

- Facebook case study: More than half of the users came back to the site every single day. This is how a company can validate its value hypothesis – that customers find the product valuable.
- For startups, the role of strategy is to help [[What's Your Problem|figure out the right questions to ask]].
- The goal of a startup’s early efforts should be to test their assumptions as quickly as possible.
- What differentiates the success stores from the failures is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapted their strategies accordingly.
- [[Persona|Customer archetype]] describes the target customer. It guides product development and aligns the team to make decisions based on whom you aim to appeal.
