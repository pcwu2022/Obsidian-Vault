### Accelerate

- Startups need organizational structures that combat extreme uncertainty.
- The value in a startup is not the creation of stuff, but rather validated learning about how to build a sustainable business.
- What products do customers really want?
- How will our business grow?
- Who is our customer?
- Which customers should we listen to, and which should we ignore?

### Batch

- Small batches = faster learning.
- _Continuous deployment_ is releasing small new features all the time. Testing them and having a system in place that can pull the andon cord if something breaks.
- The ability to learn faster from customers is the essential competitive advantage that startups must possess.
- It is not the customer, but rather our _hypothesis about the customer_, that pulls work from product development and other functions.

### Grow

- The engine of growth is the mechanism that startups use to achieve sustainable growth.
- Sustainable growth = when new customers come from the actions of past customers.
- A startup can evaluate whether it is getting closer to product/market fit by measuring the direction and degree of progress.

#### 4 Ways Past Customers Drive Sustainable Growth

1. Word of mouth
2. As a side effect of product usage
3. Through funded advertising
4. Through repeat purchase or use

#### 3 Engines of Growth

1. **Sticky Engine:** If the rate of new customer acquisition exceeds the churn rate, the product will grow. Growth rate = natural growth rate – churn rate.
2. **Viral Engine:** Feedback loop is determined by the _viral coefficient._ How many new customers will use a product as a consequence of each new customer who signs up? Viral coefficient >1 means that each person who signs up will bring, on average, more than one other person with them.
3. **Paid Engine:** A portion of revenue is spent on advertisement. Customer lifetime value and cost per acquisition are important metrics.

### Adapt

- Training is important to focus on with incremental improvements.
- Use the “Five Whys” to work through any kind of failure.
- Most mistakes are caused by flawed systems, not bad people.
- Whenever something goes wrong, ask yourself: How could I prevent myself from being in this situation ever again?

#### [[Five Whys Strategy]]

- Use it whenever new problems come up.
- Everyone who is connected to the problem needs to be at the meeting.
- Explain what it is and why the team will benefit from it.

### Innovate

- You want teams to work cross-functionally to achieve validated learning.
- The Lean Startup is a framework, not a blueprint of steps to follow.

#### Startups Need 3 Structural Attributes

1. Scarce but secure resources
2. Independent authority to develop their business
3. A personal stake in the outcome
