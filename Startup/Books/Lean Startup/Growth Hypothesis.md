The **growth hypothesis** examines how that value will drive user acquisition and retention.

### Key Components of a Growth Hypothesis

1. **Growth Mechanism**:    
    - **Word of Mouth**: Users recommending the product to others.
    - **Virality**: Users bringing others onboard as part of using the product (e.g., sharing or inviting friends).
    - **Paid Acquisition**: Growth through advertising or direct marketing.
    - **Sales Efforts**: Growth driven by sales teams targeting specific customers.
    - **[[Retention]]**: Users staying with the product over time, leading to organic growth.
    
2. **[[Target Audience]]**:  
    Identifying who will adopt the product and how they will contribute to its growth.
    
3. **Metrics for Success**:  
    Measurable indicators, such as user acquisition rate, churn rate, referral rate, or [[LTV|lifetime value]], to validate whether the growth hypothesis is working.
    
### Examples of Growth Hypotheses

#### 1. **Dropbox**:

- **Hypothesis**: Users will refer others to Dropbox because they gain additional storage space through referrals.
- **Validation**: Dropbox implemented a referral program and saw significant user growth, with referrals accounting for over 60% of signups.

#### 2. **Facebook**:

- **Hypothesis**: Growth will come through virality as users invite their friends to join the platform to connect with them.
- **Validation**: Facebook’s viral growth mechanism worked exceptionally well, with users frequently inviting others, leading to exponential growth.

#### 3. **Uber**:

- **Hypothesis**: Growth will occur through word of mouth as users share their positive experiences of reliable, affordable rides.
- **Validation**: Uber combined word-of-mouth growth with localized paid marketing efforts, enabling rapid expansion.

### Importance of the Growth Hypothesis

1. **Focuses on Scalability**:  
    Helps startups identify how their product can grow beyond its initial set of users.
    
2. **Reduces Waste**:  
    Prevents unnecessary spending on growth strategies that don’t work.
    
3. **Aligns with Product Design**:  
    Encourages building features that inherently drive growth, such as shareability or strong retention.
    
4. **Prioritizes Efforts**:  
    Guides decisions about which growth channels to invest in and experiment with.
    
### Validating the Growth Hypothesis

1. **Design Small Experiments**:
    - Test specific growth mechanisms, such as a referral program or an ad campaign, with a small audience.
    - Measure conversion rates, virality, and other key metrics.
    
2. **Analyze Metrics**:
    - Focus on metrics like the viral coefficient (how many new users each existing user brings) and customer acquisition cost (CAC) versus lifetime value (LTV).
          
3. **Iterate**:
    - Use feedback and data from experiments to refine the product or growth strategy.
      
4. **Expand**:
    - Once a growth mechanism is validated, scale it to a broader audience.
