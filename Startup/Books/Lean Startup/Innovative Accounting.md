### Measure

- Are you making your product better? How do you know?
- A good design is one that changes customer behavior for the better.
- You need a clear baseline metric, a hypothesis about what will improve that metric, and a set of experiments designed to test that hypothesis.
- A startup has to measure progress against a high bar: evidence that a sustainable business can be built around its products or services.
- Use split-test experiments where different versions of a product are offered to customers at the same time.
- Split-tests help you quickly identify what features matter to customers and which do not.
- Measure your productivity according to validated learning, not in terms of the production of new features.

#### The 3 Aâ€™s of Metrics

1. **Actionable**: Clear cause and effect between experiment and metric.
2. **Accessible**: Make the reports as simple as possible so everyone understands them.
3. **Auditable**: You must be able to test the data by hand.
