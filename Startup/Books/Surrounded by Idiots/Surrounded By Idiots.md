### Brief Outline of _Surrounded by Idiots_ by Thomas Erikson

        - **Yellow (Influencer):** Sociable, enthusiastic, creative, and optimistic, but sometimes unfocused.
        - **Green (Stable):** Loyal, patient, and empathetic, but resistant to change and conflict-averse.
        - **Blue (Analytical):** Logical, detail-oriented, and perfectionistic, though sometimes overly critical.
          
3. **[[How the Types Interact]]**
    - Strengths and weaknesses of each personality type in collaboration and communication.
