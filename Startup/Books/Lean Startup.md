**"The Lean [[Startup]]"** by Eric Ries is a guide to building startups using a more efficient and data-driven approach. The book introduces the concept of the **lean startup methodology**, which emphasizes rapid experimentation, customer feedback, and iterative product development to reduce waste and increase the likelihood of success.

1. **Build-Measure-Learn:** The core feedback loop for lean startups. It involves quickly building a minimum viable product (MVP), measuring how it performs with real customers, and learning from that data to make informed decisions about the next steps.
    
2. **Minimum Viable Product ([[MVP]]):** A simplified version of the product that allows startups to test their hypotheses with the least effort and resources. The goal is to gather valuable customer feedback rather than aiming for a perfect product.
    
3. **Validated Learning:** Startups should focus on learning what customers really want, rather than assuming. Every action taken should aim to test a hypothesis about the business, leading to data-driven decisions.
    
4. **Innovative Accounting:** Startups should measure progress using actionable metrics, rather than vanity metrics (like website visits). This helps determine whether the startup is moving toward its goal or if adjustments are needed.
    
5. **Pivot or Persevere:** Based on the learning from MVP testing, startups must decide whether to pivot (change direction) or persevere (stay the course). This decision should be based on whether the business model is proving successful or not.
    
6. **Continuous Deployment:** The practice of releasing new versions of the product frequently to quickly learn from user feedback and make adjustments.
    
7. **Lean Thinking:** Focus on eliminating waste, optimizing processes, and building only what is necessary to test assumptions and improve the product.
