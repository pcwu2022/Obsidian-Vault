Eugene Wang (王佑哲), co-founder and COO of USPACE, and founder of the Inside blog, possesses extensive entrepreneurial experience. From establishing the tech media Inside in 2010 and selling it to The News Lens in 2018, to founding Backer-Founder in 2014, Taiwan's first [[crowdfunding]] consulting firm, and launching USPACE in 2019, which has become Taiwan's largest shared parking platform. 

### Entrepreneurial Mindset

1.  **Entrepreneurship is a Continuous Learning and Adaptation Process:** Eugene emphasizes that entrepreneurship is not an overnight success but requires constant experimentation and learning. Each entrepreneurial failure becomes an opportunity to accumulate experience, ultimately laying the foundation for success. For him, entrepreneurship is a path of continuously challenging traditional markets and breaking through personal limitations.

2.  **Entrepreneurial Models Cannot Be Directly Replicated:** Entrepreneurs must understand that past successes do not guarantee future replication. [[Market]] environments change with each era and industry. Successful entrepreneurial models should focus on core principles and adapt to current [[needs]].

3.  **Methodology: "Machines, Not People":** Eugene stresses that entrepreneurs should focus on commercial models that can be systematized and scaled, rather than relying on personal expertise or networks. Inside, Backer-Founder, and USPACE all base their growth on standardized processes, providing a stable growth [[momentum]] for his ventures.

4.  **Transition from Engineer to COO:** Eugene's background is in electrical engineering, initially focusing on technology. However, as his entrepreneurial journey progressed, he shifted to management and operations. His experience demonstrates the need for entrepreneurs to possess flexible role-switching abilities, continuously adjusting their positions to the different stages of company development.

### Advice for Students

1.  **Don't Wait Until You're "Ready" to Start a Business:**
    * Eugene encourages students to boldly try entrepreneurship, even if they don't feel fully "ready." His own experience of securing angel investment at 25 and starting his second company at 28 reminds young people not to wait for the perfect moment but to learn and grow through practice.

2.  **Pay Attention to Trends and Find Your Opportunities:**
    * He points out that past success stories cannot be directly replicated, but entrepreneurs can learn from their thought processes, pay [[attention]] to changing times, and seize new opportunities.

3.  **Establish Systematic Thinking and Enhance Replicability:**
    * Eugene emphasizes that entrepreneurship is not just about showcasing personal abilities but about building a system that can operate long-term. He believes entrepreneurs should learn how to establish sustainable operational mechanisms to stand out in a fiercely competitive market.

### Confusion and Breakthroughs

1.  **Confusion and Decision-Making:**
    * Eugene mentions that confusion is often a crucial turning point. When facing uncertainty, one should actively explore and experiment rather than passively wait for answers. He recalls his high school years, winning the National Information Competition in 2000, but later choosing electrical engineering in college, which wasn't his true passion, impacting his future development.

2.  **College and Career Choices:**
    * He believes many people enter top universities for the credentials rather than genuine passion for their fields. If students are not interested in their subjects, they should engage with the external world through internships and various activities to discover their true interests.

3.  **Metaphor for Confusion: A Canoe in the Fog:**
    * Eugene likens confusion to paddling a canoe in the fog, where one can only see within a two-meter radius and is easily influenced by others. He emphasizes that the key to resolving confusion is "dissatisfaction with the status quo," actively seeking better directions rather than passively waiting.

### Keys to Success: Continuous and Disciplined Accumulation

Eugene's entrepreneurial journey teaches us that success is not achieved overnight but requires long-term accumulation and perseverance. The key to success in founding Inside, Backer-Founder, and USPACE lies in "continuous and disciplined accumulation," rather than relying on inspiration or chance. Eugene stresses that entrepreneurs should focus on tasks that can be executed immediately and discover future directions through practice.

### Founding and Development of the Inside Blog

Eugene's initial motivation for founding the Inside blog stemmed from dissatisfaction with workplace systems. After graduating from college, he served alternative military service, writing reports, but felt his work was undervalued. This led him to transform his knowledge into blog articles and share them publicly, marking the beginning of Inside's success.

In Inside's early stages, he established a strict content production mechanism: each team member had to submit three articles per week, with gamified competition to motivate writing. This system propelled Inside's rapid growth, from one article per week to 130 articles within a year, ultimately attracting investment and laying a solid foundation for development.

### Importance of Partners and Team

Eugene deeply understands the power of partners and teams in entrepreneurship. It's not a solo endeavor but requires collaboration and support. He points out that teams can bring greater growth and success, especially when members come from diverse professional backgrounds, providing complementary perspectives and abilities for multi-faceted company development.

In Inside's operations, teamwork helped exceed the initial goal of 52 articles, reaching over 300. This process not only increased team output but also fostered company development.

### Breakthroughs Through Accumulation

Eugene believes the key to entrepreneurship and personal growth is "continuous accumulation." He shares examples, like his daily writing during Inside's early days and his active knowledge [[acquisition]]. Through long-term accumulation, he established his professional abilities and excelled in his career.

He also mentions successful cases like "Lin Yusheng," who built a personal [[brand]] by writing a "toxic chicken soup" quote daily; "Iron Egg," who transitioned into a financial blogger by tracking expenses and savings; and "Miss Backer," who built [[influence]] through disciplined content accumulation.

### Conclusion

Eugene's entrepreneurial experience teaches us that successful entrepreneurship relies not just on a flash of inspiration but on continuous, disciplined effort and accumulation to establish a foothold in the market. He emphasizes that entrepreneurs should focus on sharing knowledge, choosing suitable partners, and working with teams to accumulate experience and achieve breakthroughs. The key to success is "continuous and disciplined accumulation," a mindset every entrepreneur should uphold.
