- **Market and Competition Analysis**:
    
    - Analyze competitors and position your product effectively.

    - Set a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product.
- **User-Centric Development**:
    
    - Focus on specific user groups and conduct targeted user interviews.
    - Engage with relevant users (e.g., second-year medical students) to understand their needs and challenges.
- **International Expansion**:
    
    - Present success stories backed by data (e.g., satisfaction surveys) to build credibility.
    - Understand local educational systems (e.g., the US medical education system) to tailor the marketing strategy.
- **Target Audience**:
    
    - Define your target audience clearly, with two strategies: targeting the top (professors, senior medical students) or expanding downward (high school students).
    - For high school students, create engaging and short content, like videos, to grab their attention.
- **Business Models**:
    
    - Non-profit and for-profit organizations both need a clear business model.

    - Monetize through subscriptions, sponsorships, or government collaboration.
- **Pricing and Monetization**:
    
    - Define pricing early—consider offering basic, paid, or premium options.
    - Explore monetizing through subscriptions, sponsored content, or partnerships (e.g., schools, government).
- **[[LTV|Customer Lifetime Value]] (CLV)**:
    
    - CLV is a crucial metric to measure long-term customer value.
    - Focus on repeat purchases and converting casual users into loyal customers.
    - Subscription models with low barriers to entry and easy cancellation are effective.
    - Understand conversion rates from casual users to paying customers.
- **Identifying Issues in Team Progress**:
    
    - Identify [[Niche Market|niche markets]] to focus on, such as students interested in medical fields.
    - Gather feedback from a specific user base to refine the product and its features.
- **Effective Performance Evaluation**:
    
    - Avoid vanity [[metrics]]—focus on relevant indicators like user [[retention]], recurring purchases, and CLV.
