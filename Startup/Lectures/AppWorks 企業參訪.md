## AppWorks 是什麼？

### Helping tech startups disrupt the world since 2009

In the making of a great company, founders make all the big calls. And investors play the supporting roles. As prior founders ourselves, we started AppWorks to play that role. So you can count on our support. We love founders with passion, grit, and determination. We want to be the first investor to fund you and we want to help you go all the way.
### The Support We Provide

AppWorks provides 2 main services that cater to startups in 2 different stages. AppWorks [[Accelerator]] helps seed-stage startups go from 0 to 1.
