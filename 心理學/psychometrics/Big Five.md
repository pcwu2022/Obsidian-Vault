### [[Openness]]

### [[Conscientiousness]]

### [[Extraversion]]

### [[Agreeableness]]

### [[Neuroticism]]

### Positive Personality Traits
Positive personality traits are traits that can be beneficial to have. These traits may help you be a better person or make it easier to cope with challenges you may face in life. Personality traits that are considered positive include:
- Adaptable
- Ambitious
- Considerate
- Cooperative
- Friendly
- Gracious
- Humble
- Insightful
- Objective
- Optimistic
- Respectful
- Steady
- Thorough
- Well-rounded

### Negative Personality Traits
Negative personality traits are those that may be more harmful than helpful. These are traits that may hold you back in your life or hurt your relationships with others. (They're also good traits to focus on for personal growth.) Personality traits that fall in the negative category include:
- Aggressive
- Arrogant
- Cold
- Deceptive
- Egotistical
- Guarded
- Intolerant
- Judgmental
- Moody
- Neglectful
- Pompous
- Selfish
- Unreliable
- Withdrawn

For example, if you score high in openness, you are more likely to have the positive personality trait of creativity. If you score low in openness, you may be more likely to have the negative personality trait of being unimaginative.

### Factors Influencing Personality Traits
Research suggests that both biological and environmental influences play a role in shaping our personalities. Twin studies suggest that both nature and nurture play a role in the development of each of the five personality traits.

One study of the genetic and environmental underpinnings of the five traits looked at 123 pairs of identical twins and 127 pairs of fraternal twins. The findings suggested that the heritability of each personality trait was:
- 53% for extraversion
- 41% for agreeableness
- 44% for conscientiousness
- 41% for neuroticism
- 61% for openness

Longitudinal studies also suggest that these big five personality traits tend to be relatively stable over the course of adulthood. One four-year study of working-age adults found that personality changed little as a result of adverse life events.

Studies show that maturation may have an impact on the five personality traits. As people age, they tend to become less extraverted, less neurotic, and less open to experience. Agreeableness and conscientiousness, on the other hand, tend to increase as people grow older.
