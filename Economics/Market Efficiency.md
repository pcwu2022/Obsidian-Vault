- **Market Efficiency:**
    
    - Welfare Economics: Studies how resource allocation affects economic well-being.
    - Total Surplus: The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus (Value to buyers - Cost to sellers).
    - Efficiency: A resource allocation that maximizes total surplus received by all members of society.
    - Market Equilibrium: In competitive markets, the equilibrium of [[supply and demand]] maximizes total surplus.
    - Insights of Market Outcomes:
        - Goods are allocated to buyers who value them most (highest willingness to pay).
        - Demand is allocated to sellers who can produce at the least cost.
        - The equilibrium quantity maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
    - Laissez-faire: The idea that the benevolent social planner should leave the market outcome as it is due to its efficiency ("invisible hand").
- **Examples:**
    
    - Ticket Scalping: Illustrates how markets allocate goods to those with the highest willingness to pay, which economists generally view as efficient.
    - Market for Organs: Raises ethical questions about market efficiency versus fairness, as current regulations impose a price ceiling of zero.
- **Market Efficiency and Market Failure:**
    
    - Market Power: A single buyer or seller's ability to control market prices can lead to inefficiency by distorting price and quantity.
    - [[Externalities]]: Side effects of production or consumption that affect non-participants can cause market equilibrium to be inefficient as buyers and sellers don't consider these external costs or benefits.
