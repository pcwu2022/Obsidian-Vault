- **Different Kinds of Goods:** Goods can be categorized based on two characteristics:
    
    - **Excludability:** Can people be prevented from using the good?
    - **Rivalry in Consumption:** Does one person's use reduce another's ability to use it?
- **Four Types of Goods:**
    
    - **Private Goods:** Excludable and rival (e.g., ice cream).
    - **[[Public Goods]]:** Not excludable and not rival (e.g., national defense).
    - **[[Common Resources]]:** Not excludable but rival (e.g., fish in the ocean).
    - **Club Goods (Natural Monopolies):** Excludable but not rival (e.g., cable TV).
- **The Importance of Property Rights:**
    
    - Market failure can occur when property rights are not well-established, meaning no one has the legal authority to control a valuable item.
    - The absence of property rights can lead to the overuse of [[common resources]] (as seen in the historical example of deer hunting in Dutch colonial Taiwan).
    - Government intervention can potentially solve market failures arising from poorly defined property rights.
