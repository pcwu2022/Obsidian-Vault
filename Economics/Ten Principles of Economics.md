## Introduction

Economics is derived from the Greek word "_oikonomos_," meaning "one who manages a household." Both households and economies face decisions about allocating scarce resources. Economics studies how society manages its scarce resources through:

- How people make decisions
- How people interact with one another
- Forces and trends affecting the economy as a whole

## Ten Principles of Economics

### How People Make Decisions

1. **People Face Trade-offs**
    
    - "There is no such thing as a free lunch"
    - Examples: guns vs. butter, food vs. clothing, leisure vs. work
    - Efficiency (getting the most from scarce resources) vs. equity (distributing benefits equally)
2. **The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It**
    
    - Decisions require comparing costs and benefits of alternatives
    - The [[Opportunity Cost]] of an item is what you give up to get that item
    - Example: Cost of college includes not just tuition but time (which could be spent working)
3. **Rational People Think at the Margin**
    
    - Rational people systematically do the best they can to achieve objectives
    - Marginal changes are small, incremental adjustments to existing plans
    - Decisions are made by comparing [[Marginal Costs]] and marginal benefits
    - Examples:
        - Average vs. marginal cost of flying a passenger
        - Why water is cheap despite being essential (plentiful supply means low marginal benefit)
        - Healthcare premiums vs. co-payments
        - Fuel taxes: per vehicle vs. per gallon
4. **People Respond to Incentives**
    
    - Incentives induce action through rewards or punishments
    - People choose alternatives when marginal benefits exceed marginal costs
    - Policy implications:
        - Gasoline taxes encourage fuel-efficient cars, carpooling, public transport
        - Seat belt laws may change driving behavior (safer drivers might drive more recklessly)

### How People Interact

5. **Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off**
    
    - People gain from their ability to trade with one another
    - Trade, private property rights, and freedom are interconnected
    - Trade promotes specialization and division of labor
6. **Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity**
    
    - Market economy allocates resources through decentralized decisions
    - Adam Smith's "invisible hand" guides households and firms
    - Prices help decision-makers maximize social welfare
    - Government interference with prices can impede market coordination
7. **Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes**
    
    - Markets require enforcement of property rights
    - Market failures occur when resources aren't allocated efficiently
    - Government intervention may promote efficiency and equity in cases of:
        - [[Externalities]] (impacts on bystanders, e.g., pollution)
        - Market power (ability to unduly influence prices)
    - Government improvement isn't guaranteed due to imperfect political processes

### How The Economy as a Whole Works

8. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money
10. Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment
