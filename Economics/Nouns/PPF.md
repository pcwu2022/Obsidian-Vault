The Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) is a curve that shows the maximum possible combinations of two goods or services that an economy can produce using all available resources efficiently.

It illustrates the trade-offs, opportunity costs, and the concept of scarcity in economics.

### Key Concepts:

- Efficiency: Points on the PPF represent efficient use of resources.
- Inefficiency: Points inside the PPF show underutilization of resources.
- Unattainability: Points outside the PPF are not currently possible with existing resources.
- Opportunity Cost: Moving along the curve involves giving up some of one good to produce more of the other.
    
### Example: Guns vs. Butter

An economy can produce two goods: guns and butter.

|Point|Guns|Butter|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|0|100|All resources to butter|
|B|20|80|Balanced production|
|C|40|50|More guns, less butter|
|D|60|0|All resources to guns|

- Moving from B to C → Gain 20 guns, lose 30 butter → opportunity cost = 30 butter.
    
### Shape of the Curve:

- The PPF is usually concave (bowed out) due to increasing opportunity cost — resources are not perfectly adaptable between goods.
- A straight-line PPF suggests constant opportunity costs.

### Shifts in the PPF:

- Outward Shift: Economic growth, better technology, more resources.
- Inward Shift: Natural disaster, war, resource depletion.
