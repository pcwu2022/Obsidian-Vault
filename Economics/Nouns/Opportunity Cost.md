**Definition**:  
**Opportunity cost** is the value of the **next best alternative** that is **forgone** when making a decision. It's not just about money—it includes time, resources, or any benefit you give up in choosing one option over another.

**Why It Matters**:  
Understanding opportunity cost helps individuals, businesses, and governments make more informed and efficient choices by considering what is sacrificed when selecting one option over another.

### Example: Choosing How to Spend 1 Hour

Suppose you have **1 free hour** and three options:

| Option                 | Benefit (in value or satisfaction) |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Study for an exam      | 90                                 |
| Watch a TV show        | 60                                 |
| Scroll on social media | 20                                 |

If you choose to **study**, the **opportunity cost** is the value of the **next best alternative**, which is **watching a TV show** (60).

So, the opportunity cost of studying = **60**.

### Key Insight:

Opportunity cost is **not** the sum of all other alternatives—it's the **value of the single best alternative** that is _not_ chosen.
