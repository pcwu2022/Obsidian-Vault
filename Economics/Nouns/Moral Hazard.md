Moral hazard is a concept in economics and risk management that describes a situation where one party engages in riskier behavior knowing that they are protected from the consequences of that risk. Here's a breakdown:

**Core Idea:**

- It arises when there's a separation between the person taking a risk and the person bearing the cost of that risk.
- This separation creates an incentive for the risk-taker to act in a way they wouldn't if they had to bear the full consequences.

**Key Aspects:**

- **Information Asymmetry:**
    - Moral hazard often occurs when one party has more information about their actions than the other.
- **Change in Behavior:**
    - The key is that behavior changes _after_ an agreement or transaction has taken place.
- **Risk-Taking:**
    - It involves an increased tendency to take risks because the potential negative outcomes are partially or fully shielded.

**Examples:**

- **Insurance:**
    - Someone with car insurance might drive more recklessly, knowing that the insurance will cover damages.
    - Similarly, with health insurance, individuals may be less concerned about preventative health measures.
- **Financial Industry:**
    - Banks might take on excessive risks if they believe they'll be bailed out by the government. The 2008 financial crisis is often cited as an example.
- **Workplace:**
    - An employee with a company car might be less careful with it than if it were their own.
