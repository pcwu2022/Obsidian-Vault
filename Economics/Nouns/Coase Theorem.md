**Definition**:  
The **Coase Theorem**, proposed by economist **Ronald Coase**, states that if **property rights are well-defined** and **transaction costs are negligible**, private parties can **negotiate solutions to externalities** on their own, leading to an **efficient allocation of resources**—regardless of who holds the initial rights.

**Key Points**:
- **Externalities**: Effects of a transaction that impact third parties (e.g., pollution).
- **Well-defined property rights**: It's clear who owns what.
- **Zero transaction costs**: No cost to bargain, enforce, or communicate.
    
**An Example for the Coase Theorem**

* **The Scenario:**
    - Emily owns a dog, Clifford, which benefits her.
    - Horace, Emily's neighbor, is negatively affected by the dog's barking (a negative externality).
- **The Question:**
    - Should Emily keep the dog?
    - Does it matter who has the legal right regarding the dog?

- Case I: Emily has the right of keeping a dog.

	* If the benefit of having a dog is $1000 while Horace bears an $1500 cost from the barking.
	* The socially efficient outcome is not to keep the dog.
	* This can be reached by Horace’s offering an amount that is greater than $1000, but less than $1500 to Emily.
	* If the benefit of having a dog is $3000 while Horace bears an $1500 cost from the barking.
	* The socially efficient outcome is to keep the dog.
	* This is reached since Horace is not willing to offer more than $1500 for Emily to give up the dog.

- Case II: Horace has the right of not being bothered by dog’s barking.

	* If the benefit of having a dog is $1000 while Horace bears an $1500 cost from the barking.
	* The socially efficient outcome is not to keep the dog.
	* This can be reached since Emily is not willing to pay more than $1000 to keep the dog.
	* If the benefit of having a dog is $3000 while Horace bears an $1500 cost from the barking.
	* The socially efficient outcome is to keep the dog.
	* This can be reached if Emily offers more than $1500 for Horace to allow him to keep the dog.

* Therefore, no matter who has the right of keeping the dog or not being disturbed by dog barking, as long as Emily and Horace can bargain without cost, the resulting outcomes are the same.
* The outcome is efficient.
* However, the distribution of benefits are different under different assignment of property rights.

    
**Limitations**:

- High transaction costs (e.g., too many parties or legal barriers)
- Difficult to assign or enforce property rights
- Information asymmetry
