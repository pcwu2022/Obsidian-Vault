Adverse selection is a situation where sellers have information that buyers do not have, or vice versa, about some aspect of product quality. This information asymmetry leads to a "selection" of participants in a [[market]] that is "adverse" to one side of the transaction. Here's a breakdown:

**Core Concept:**

- **Information Asymmetry:**
    - The key element is that one party in a transaction possesses more relevant information than the other.
- **"Adverse" Selection:**
    - This information gap results in those with higher risks or less desirable attributes being more likely to engage in the transaction.
- **Market Imbalance:**
    - This can lead to a market where the "bad" or high-risk participants drive out the "good" or low-risk participants.

**Examples:**

- **Insurance:**
    - In health insurance, individuals with pre-existing health conditions (who know they are more likely to need healthcare) are more likely to purchase insurance. This can lead to insurance companies having a pool of higher-risk individuals, forcing them to raise premiums for everyone, which then discourages healthy individuals from buying insurance.
- **Used Car Market:**
    - Sellers of used cars often know more about the car's condition than buyers. This can lead to a situation where only sellers of "lemons" (defective cars) are willing to sell, as sellers of good cars are unwilling to accept the lower prices buyers are willing to pay due to the risk of getting a "lemon."
- **Financial Markets:**
    - In lending, borrowers who know they are high-risk (more likely to default) are more likely to seek loans. This can lead to lenders having a pool of high-risk borrowers, increasing the risk of defaults.
