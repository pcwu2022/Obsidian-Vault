- **Common Resources:**
    
    - Like public goods, they are not excludable but are rival in consumption.
    - **Tragedy of the commons**
	    - it is a situation where individuals, acting in their own self-interest, **overuse and deplete a shared resource**, even though it’s bad for everyone in the long run.
	    - EX: If everyone lets their cows graze freely on a shared pasture, the grass gets overgrazed and eventually destroyed — hurting all the farmers.
	    - It highlights how **common resources** can be **overexploited** when there's no regulation or collective agreement on sustainable use.
    - Examples include clean air and water, congested roads, and wildlife.
    - Potential solutions involve government regulation (e.g., taxes, quotas) or creating private property rights.
