**Marginal Cost (MC)** is the **additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of a good or service**. It plays a central role in [[Economics|microeconomics]] and is crucial for decision-making in [[Strategy|business strategy]] and production economics.

$Marginal Cost (MC)=ΔTotal CostΔQuantity\text{Marginal Cost (MC)} = \frac{\Delta \text{Total Cost}}{\Delta \text{Quantity}}$
### Key Characteristics

- **Short-run concept**: It often assumes at least one input is fixed (e.g., capital or factory size).
    
- **U-shaped curve**: Initially, marginal costs may decline due to increasing returns to scale or [[Learning Curve Effects|learning curve effects]], but they eventually rise due to diminishing marginal returns.
    
- **Used in optimization**: Firms compare **marginal cost (MC)** with **marginal revenue (MR)** to determine the optimal level of production.
    

### Relationship to Other Cost Concepts

- **Total Cost (TC)**: Sum of fixed and variable costs.    
- **Average Cost (AC)**: TC divided by quantity.    
- **Fixed Costs**: Do not change with output (e.g., rent, salaried labor).    
- **Variable Costs**: Change with output (e.g., materials, hourly labor).    
- **MC affects AC**: If MC < AC, then AC falls. If MC > AC, then AC rises. MC intersects AC at AC's minimum point.
    
### Graphical Insight

- In a typical cost curve graph:    
    - MC initially decreases due to increased efficiency       
    - Then rises due to resource constraints or overutilization        
- The **minimum point of the average total cost (ATC)** curve is where **MC = ATC**
    
### Strategic Applications

- **[[Pricing]] decisions**: Especially in competitive markets where firms may price near marginal cost.    
- **Profit maximization**: A firm maximizes profit when **MC = MR**.    
- **Break-even analysis**: Helps in determining at what point the firm covers all costs.
    
### Real-World Examples

- **Manufacturing**: If a factory adds one more unit of output and this requires hiring overtime labor or running extra shifts, that extra cost is the MC.    
- **Software companies**: Once the product is developed, the marginal cost of distributing one more copy (e.g., via download) is nearly zero.    
- **Airlines**: Adding one passenger to a flight with available seats costs very little (fuel, snacks), so marginal cost pricing (e.g., last-minute deals) is common.
