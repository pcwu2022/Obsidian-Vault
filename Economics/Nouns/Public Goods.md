- **Public Goods:**
    
    - Pose a challenge for economic analysis as they lack prices for efficient market allocation.
    - Private markets often fail to produce them in proper amounts due to the **free-rider problem**, where individuals benefit without paying.
    - Examples include national defense, basic research, and potentially fighting poverty.
    - Governments can potentially solve this by providing the good and funding it through taxes.
    - **Cost-benefit analysis** is used to determine if the total benefits of a public good outweigh the costs, but it is often difficult due to the absence of market prices and challenges in quantifying benefits (e.g., the value of a human life).
