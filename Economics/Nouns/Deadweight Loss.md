**Definition**:  
**Deadweight loss** is the **loss of economic efficiency** that occurs when the equilibrium outcome in a [[market]] is not achieved or not achievable. It typically arises from **market distortions** such as **taxes**, **price ceilings/floors**, or **monopoly pricing**.

In simpler terms, it's the value of trades that **could have happened** but didn't, due to some interference in the market.

### Common Causes of Deadweight Loss:

- **Taxes**: Reduce the quantity traded below the free-market level.
    
- **Price controls**: Such as rent ceilings or minimum wages.
    
- **Monopolies**: Charge higher prices and produce less than competitive firms.
    
- **Subsidies**: Can also cause inefficiencies if they distort consumption or production.
    
### Graphical Explanation:

Imagine a supply and demand graph:

- In a free market, [[supply and demand]] meet at the **equilibrium point**, maximizing total [[surplus]] (consumer + producer surplus).
    
- When a **tax** is added, the new price for buyers rises, the price received by sellers falls, and **fewer units** are sold.
    
- The **area between the demand and supply curves** for the units no longer traded represents the **deadweight loss**.
    
### Numerical Example:

| Scenario    | Quantity Sold | Total Surplus |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Free Market | 100 units     | $500          |
| With Tax    | 80 units      | $450          |

**Deadweight Loss = $500 - $450 = $50**  
â†’ $50 of mutually beneficial trade is lost because of the tax.

### Key Takeaway:

Deadweight loss shows that when markets are **not allowed to reach equilibrium**, **total societal welfare decreases**, even if some groups benefit (like the government through tax revenue).
