**Comparative advantage** is the ability of an individual, business, or country to produce a good or service at a **lower [[Opportunity Cost]]** than others. It explains **why trade is beneficial**, even if one party is more efficient at producing everything.

### Key Idea:

Even if one country is better at producing all goods (**absolute advantage**), both countries can still benefit from trade if they **specialize** in what they are relatively best at—that is, where they have a **comparative advantage**.

### Example: Two Countries, Two Goods

|       | Country A (hours to produce 1 unit) | Country B (hours to produce 1 unit) |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Cloth | 2                                   | 4                                   |
| Wine  | 6                                   | 8                                   |


- **Opportunity Cost for A**:
    - 1 Cloth = ⅓ Wine (2 hours vs. 6 hours)
        
- **Opportunity Cost for B**:
    - 1 Cloth = ½ Wine (4 hours vs. 8 hours)
    

**Result**:
- Country A has a **comparative advantage in cloth** (lower opportunity cost).
- Country B has a **comparative advantage in wine**.
    
**Therefore**, A should specialize in cloth, B in wine, and they should **trade**.
