* **U.S. Taxation: The Big Picture**
    * Taxes in the U.S. have significantly increased since Benjamin Franklin's time, now [[accounting]] for a substantial portion of the average American's income (up to a third). This is lower than many European countries but higher than some other nations.
    * The federal government collects the majority of taxes, with individual income tax being the largest revenue source.
    * Other significant federal taxes include payroll taxes (for Social Security and Medicare), corporate income taxes (taxing profits), and excise taxes (on specific goods).
    * Taiwan's income tax rates (as of 2024) are progressive, ranging from 5% to 40% based on income brackets.
* **Taxes and Efficiency**
    * Policymakers aim for tax systems that are both efficient and equitable.
    * An efficient tax system raises revenue with minimal cost to taxpayers, encompassing:
        * The tax payment itself.
        * Deadweight losses (distortions of incentives).
        * Administrative burdens (compliance costs).
    * [[Deadweight Loss]] arises because taxes distort incentives, leading to a reduction in economic well-being exceeding the revenue collected.
    * Administrative burdens involve the time and money spent complying with tax laws.
    * Debate exists on whether income or consumption should be taxed, with consumption tax potentially reducing disincentives to save.
    * **Marginal Tax Rate**: The rate you pay on your **next dollar of income**. It applies to the highest income bracket you fall into. It's useful for understanding how additional income will be taxed.
	- **Average Tax Rate**: The **total tax you pay divided by your total income**. It reflects the overall percentage of your income that goes to taxes.
    * Lump-sum tax (fixed amount for everyone) is the most efficient as it has no [[Deadweight Loss]] and minimal administrative burden, but is generally considered unfair.
* **Taxes and Equity**
    * Tax equity concerns how the tax burden is distributed across the population.
    * The **benefits principle** suggests taxes should be based on the benefits received from government services (e.g., gasoline tax for roads).
    * The **ability-to-pay principle** argues that taxes should be levied based on one's capacity to bear the burden. This leads to:
        * **Vertical equity:** Higher-income taxpayers should pay more.
        * **Horizontal equity:** Taxpayers with similar abilities should pay the same.
    * Tax systems can be:
        * **Proportional:** Everyone pays the same percentage of income.
        * **Regressive:** Lower-income earners pay a larger percentage.
        * **Progressive:** Higher-income earners pay a larger percentage.
    * **Tax incidence** studies who ultimately bears the burden of a tax, which may not be the entity directly paying it. The "flypaper theory" (burden sticks where it lands) is often inaccurate.
    * The corporate income tax burden, for example, can fall on owners, customers, or workers through reduced investment, higher prices, or lower wages.
