- **A Parable for the Modern Economy:** Illustrates how individuals rely on countless others for goods and services, highlighting economic interdependence facilitated by trade. This trade is driven by self-interest, not generosity or government direction.
    
- **One of the [[Ten Principles of Economics]]:** Trade can make everyone better off. This leads to the questions of what people gain from trade and why interdependence arises among individuals and nations.
    
- **A Simple Model (Potato Farmer & Cattle Rancher):**
    
    - Examines a two-good (potatoes & meat), two-person economy to understand the basis for trade.
    - **Production Possibilities:** Without trade, consumption is limited to individual production capabilities.
    - **Specialization and Trade:** Individuals can benefit by specializing in what they produce best and trading with each other.
- **Comparative Advantage: The Driving Force of Specialization:**
    
    - Explores why specialization and trade are beneficial even when one party has an absolute advantage in producing both goods.
    - **Absolute Advantage (絕對利益):** The ability to produce a good using fewer inputs than another producer.
    - **Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage:**
        - **Opportunity Cost:** What must be given up to obtain something.
        - **Comparative Advantage:** The ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer.
    - Specialization and trade are based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. Differences in opportunity costs create the basis for mutually beneficial trade.
- **Comparative Advantage and Trade:**
    
    - Gains from trade arise from specializing in the activity with a lower opportunity cost.
    - Trade allows individuals (and countries) to consume beyond their own production possibilities.
    - **The Price of Trade:** For trade to be mutually beneficial, the trading price must fall between the two parties' opportunity costs.
- **Applications of Comparative Advantage:**
    
    - Discusses real-world applications, such as whether high-profile individuals should perform their own services (lawn mowing) or specialize.
    - Considers [[international trade]], noting that while it can benefit a country as a whole, it may negatively impact certain individuals within the country.
- **FYI—The Legacy of Adam Smith and David Ricardo:**
    
    - **Adam Smith:** His work in "The Wealth of Nations" (1776) analyzed trade and economic interdependence.
    - **David Ricardo:** Developed the principle of comparative advantage in his "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation" (1817).
