**I. Markets and Competition**
* **Market:** A group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service.
* **Competition:**
    * **Competitive Market:** Many buyers and sellers with negligible impact on price (price takers).
    * **Perfect Competition:** Identical products, numerous buyers and sellers.
    * **Monopoly:** One seller controls the price.
    * **Oligopoly:** Few sellers, may not always compete aggressively.
    * **Monopolistic Competition:** Many sellers with slightly differentiated products, each can set their own price.

**II. Demand**
* **Quantity Demanded:** Amount of a good buyers are willing and able to purchase.
* **Law of Demand:** Other things equal, quantity demanded falls when price rises.
* **Demand Schedule:** Table showing the relationship between price and quantity demanded.
* **Demand Curve:** Graph of the relationship between price and quantity demanded.
* **Market Demand:** Sum of all individual demands (horizontal summation of individual demand curves).
* **Shifts in the Demand Curve:** Caused by changes in factors other than price:
    * **Income:** Normal goods (demand increases with income), Inferior goods (demand decreases with income).
    * **Prices of Related Goods:** Substitutes (fall in price of one reduces demand for the other), Complements (fall in price of one increases demand for the other).
    * **Tastes:** Changes in preferences.
    * **Expectations:** Future price or income expectations.
    * **Number of Buyers:** Increase in buyers increases demand.

**III. Supply**
* **Quantity Supplied:** Amount of a good sellers are willing and able to sell.
* **Law of Supply:** Other things equal, quantity supplied rises when price rises.
* **Supply Schedule:** Table showing the relationship between price and quantity supplied.
* **Supply Curve:** Graph of the relationship between price and quantity supplied.
* **Market Supply:** Sum of all individual supplies (horizontal summation of individual supply curves).
* **Shifts in the Supply Curve:** Caused by changes in factors other than price:
    * **Input Prices:** Cost of resources used in production.
    * **Technology:** Improvements in production methods.
    * **Expectations:** Future price expectations.
    * **Number of Sellers:** Increase in sellers increases supply.

**IV. Supply and Demand Together**
* **Equilibrium:** Price where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.
* **Equilibrium Price:** Market-clearing price.
* **Equilibrium Quantity:** Quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price.
* **Surplus:** Quantity supplied > quantity demanded (price above equilibrium).
* **Shortage:** Quantity demanded > quantity supplied (price below equilibrium).
* **Law of Supply and Demand:** Price adjusts to bring supply and demand into balance.
* **Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium (Three Steps):**
    1.  Identify if the event shifts supply, demand, or both.
    2.  Determine the direction of the shift.
    3.  Analyze how the shift affects equilibrium price and quantity.
* **Shifts vs. Movements:** Change in supply/demand (shift of the curve), Change in quantity supplied/demanded (movement along the curve).
* **Case Studies:** Price increases after disasters, the concept of "fairness" vs. market forces.
