**I. The Surprising Effects of Price Controls**

- **Definition:** Government-imposed legal limits on the price of a good or service.
- **Types:**
    - **Price Ceiling (上限):** A legal maximum price.
        - **Non-binding:** Set above the equilibrium price, no effect.
        - **Binding:** Set below the equilibrium price, leads to a shortage (Quantity Demanded > Quantity Supplied).
        - **Consequences of Binding Price Ceiling:** Shortages, non-price rationing (e.g., long lines, discrimination), reduced incentive for suppliers to maintain quality.
        - **Examples:** Gasoline shortages in the 1970s, rent control. Rent control in the long run leads to significant housing shortages due to inelastic long-run [[supply and demand]].
    - **Price Floor (下限):** A legal minimum price.
        - **Non-binding:** Set below the equilibrium price, no effect.
        - **Binding:** Set above the equilibrium price, leads to a surplus (Quantity Supplied > Quantity Demanded).
        - **Consequences of Binding Price Floor:** Surpluses, non-price rationing by buyers.
        - **Examples:** Minimum wage, agricultural price supports. Minimum wage's impact is greatest on low-skilled, teenage labor, potentially causing unemployment.
- **Evaluation of Price Controls:** Distort market signals, can harm those they intend to help. Alternative solutions like subsidies can be more effective but have their own costs (higher taxes).

**II. The Surprising Study of Tax Incidence**

- **Tax Incidence (賦稅歸屬):** The distribution of the tax burden among buyers and sellers.
- **Taxes on Sellers:** Increase production costs, shift the supply curve left (upward by the tax amount), lead to a higher equilibrium price and lower quantity. Buyers pay more, and sellers receive less.
- **Taxes on Buyers:** Make consumption less attractive, shift the demand curve left (downward by the tax amount), lead to a lower equilibrium price and lower quantity. Buyers effectively pay more, and sellers receive less.
- **Equivalence of Taxes:** Taxes on buyers and sellers are equivalent in terms of their impact on the equilibrium price, quantity, and the sharing of the tax burden.
- **Payroll Tax (FICA):** Tax on wages, the burden is shared between workers (lower wages received) and firms (higher wages paid) regardless of the legislated division.
- **[[Elasticity]] and Tax Incidence:**
    - The burden of a tax falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic.
    - Inelastic demand: Buyers bear more of the burden.
    - Inelastic supply: Sellers bear more of the burden.
    - [[Elasticity]] reflects the willingness to leave the market when conditions worsen. The side with fewer alternatives bears more of the tax burden.
- **Luxury Tax Example:** The burden of the 1990s luxury tax on items like yachts fell more on suppliers (who likely had a more inelastic supply in the short run) than the wealthy buyers (with elastic demand), leading to unintended economic consequences and eventual repeal.
