- **Elasticity:** Measures the responsiveness of buyers and sellers to changes in market conditions, allowing for precise analysis of [[supply and demand]].
    
- **Price Elasticity of Demand:**
    
    - Definition: Percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.
    - Determinants:
        - Availability of close substitutes (more substitutes ⟹ more elastic).
        - Necessities vs. Luxuries (luxuries ⟹ more elastic).
        - Market definition (narrower ⟹ more elastic).
        - Time horizon (longer ⟹ more elastic).
    - Computation:
        - Formula: % change in price% change in quantity demanded​
        - Midpoint Method: Preferred for consistent results: (P2​−P1​)/((P2​+P1​)/2)(Q2​−Q1​)/((Q2​+Q1​)/2)​
    - Types of Demand Curves:
        - Inelastic (<1): Quantity demanded responds weakly to price changes.
        - Elastic (>1): Quantity demanded responds strongly to price changes.
        - Unit Elastic (=1): Quantity demanded changes proportionally to price.
        - Perfectly Inelastic (=0): Quantity demanded does not change with price.
        - Perfectly Elastic (∞): Quantity demanded changes infinitely with any price change.
    - Relationship with Slope: Inversely related, but not the same.
    - Total Revenue (TR = P x Q):
        - Inelastic demand: Price increase ⟹ TR increase; Price decrease ⟹ TR decrease.
        - Elastic demand: Price increase ⟹ TR decrease; Price decrease ⟹ TR increase.
        - Unit elastic demand: TR remains constant with price changes.
- **Other Demand Elasticities:**
    
    - **Income Elasticity of Demand:** Measures how quantity demanded changes with consumer income: % change in income% change in quantity demanded​.
        - Normal goods (positive elasticity) vs. Inferior goods (negative elasticity).
        - Necessities (small elasticity) vs. Luxuries (large elasticity).
    - **Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand:** Measures how quantity demanded of one good changes with the price of another good: % change in price of good 2% change in quantity demanded of good 1​.
        - Substitutes (positive elasticity) vs. Complements (negative elasticity).
- **Elasticity of Supply:**
    
    - Definition: Measures how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in the price of that good: % change in price% change in quantity supplied​.
    - Determinants:
        - Flexibility of sellers to change production (more flexible ⟹ more elastic).
        - Time period (longer ⟹ more elastic).
    - Types of Supply Curves: Similar to demand (inelastic, elastic, unit elastic, perfectly inelastic, perfectly elastic).
- **Three Applications:**
    
    1. **Good news for farming can be bad for farmers:** Increased productivity (supply shift right) can lower total revenue if demand is inelastic.
    2. **Why OPEC failed to keep oil prices high:** Short-run inelastic demand and supply become more elastic in the long run due to alternative sources and conservation.
    3. **Does drug interdiction increase or decrease drug-related crime?** Interdiction (supply shift left) raises price and lowers quantity, potentially increasing crime. Education (demand shift left) lowers both price and quantity.
