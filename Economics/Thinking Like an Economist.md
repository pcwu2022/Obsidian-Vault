## The Economist as a Scientist

### Economic Way of Thinking

- Involves analytical and objective thinking
- Uses the scientific method
- Develops and tests theories with data
- Employs abstract models to explain complex real-world phenomena

### Scientific Method in Economics

- Based on observation, theory development, and further observation
- Unlike physical sciences, economics often cannot conduct controlled experiments
- Economists rely on natural experiments from history to test theories
- Economists make strategic assumptions to simplify reality

### Economic Models

1. **Circular-Flow Diagram**
    
    - Visual model showing dollar flows between households and firms
    - Firms: Produce goods/services (revenue) and use factors of production (spending)
    - Households: Own factors of production (revenue) and consume goods/services (spending)
    - Two markets: Goods and services market, and factors of production market
    - Simplifies complex relationships but captures essential economic interactions
2. **[[PPF|Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)]]**
    
    - Graph showing possible combinations of outputs given available resources
    - Illustrates key economic concepts:
        - **Efficiency**: Points on the [[PPF]] are efficient (getting maximum output from resources)
        - **Trade-offs**: Moving along the PPF requires giving up one good to produce more of another
        - **[[Opportunity Cost]]**: The PPF's slope shows how much of one good must be sacrificed
        - **Economic Growth**: Shown by an outward shift of the entire PPF

### Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics

- **Microeconomics**: Studies individual parts of the economy (households, firms, specific markets)
- **Macroeconomics**: Examines the economy as a whole (inflation, unemployment, growth)

## The Economist as Policy Advisor

### Positive vs. Normative Analysis

- **Positive statements**: Describe the world as it is (descriptive analysis)
    - Example: "An increase in minimum wage will cause a decrease in employment among the least-skilled"
    - Example: "Higher federal budget deficits will cause interest rates to increase"
- **Normative statements**: Describe how the world should be (prescriptive analysis)
    - Example: "The income gains from a higher minimum wage are worth more than slight reductions in employment"
    - Example: "State governments should be allowed to collect from tobacco companies the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses"

### Why Economic Advice Isn't Always Followed

- Economic advice is only one input in policymaking
- Politicians must consider other factors (political concerns, communication strategies, legislative realities)
- Economists provide crucial input, but their advice is just one ingredient in a complex decision process

## Why Economists Disagree

- Different theories about how the world works (positive disagreements)
- Different values about what policies should accomplish (normative disagreements)

## Cause and Effect in Economic Analysis

### Challenges in Establishing Causality

- Correlation between variables doesn't necessarily imply causation
- Two major problems in interpreting data:

1. **Omitted Variables**
    
    - Example: Correlation between cigarette lighter ownership and cancer
    - Not considering smoking as a variable leads to incorrect conclusions
    - Important to ask if movements of an omitted variable could explain observed results
2. **Reverse Causality**
    
    - Example: Correlation between police officers and crime rates
    - Does more police cause more crime, or does more crime cause cities to hire more police?
    - Without controlled experiments, it's difficult to determine direction of causality
    - Timing of events isn't always reliable (people often act based on expectations of future conditions)
    - Example: Couples buy minivans before having children, but minivans don't cause population growth
