# Setting the stage: introduction to the research

In the current digital world, social media platforms have become essential for communication and marketing. Facebook in particular offers the convenience of reaching a large audience with just one post, making it a valuable tool for students and small business owners. NTU台大學生交流版 is a Facebook group linked to National Taiwan University that serves as a community hub for exchanging information among students and local businesses. Effectively delivering your message in this space can be difficult due to the sheer volume of the content. This research aims to explore the mechanics of user engagement within this group, to inform better communication strategies. Good Intro

# The stakes: why this matters

This topic is important because it determines how effectively we communicate on the wide and powerful world of social media. In an environment where attention is invaluable, knowing how to stand out from the noise is a precious skill. For students and researchers in particular, mastering this can mean the difference between being ignored and going viral. With limited resources, the ability to create viral content can level up the playing field. It allows everyone a fair chance to reach many people and help them achieve their goals, whether they are related to society, education, or research.

# Research intent: goals

The goal of this proposal is to empower researchers whose work holds the potential to drive transformative change globally by aiding them in reaching a broader audience and conveying their message more effectively. We recognize the critical importance of capturing attention in the crowded digital landscape, particularly within the NTU台大學生交流版 Facebook group. Through an in-depth analysis of user engagement patterns and the application of tailored strategies, this research aims to uncover the keys to effective communication in this forum. This, in turn, could support students in achieving viral success, thereby amplifying their messages and potentially initiating significant societal and educational impacts. By identifying specific characteristics and best practices that enhance engagement, we can provide everyone with the opportunity to succeed regardless of their initial resources. Good application of “general to specific” strategy.

# Identifying the obstacles: the key challenges

The primary problem is the oversaturation of content within the NTU Facebook group, which leads to the loss of important messages, thus failing to reach the intended audience. Identifying the characteristics that contribute to higher engagement and broader reach is crucial. These characteristics may involve aspects of content creation such as timing, imagery, use of language, and understanding of audience behavior. You should merge this paragraph with the previous one to form a discussion of “challenges, impacts, and intended proposal goal”

# A critical review: insights from existing solutions

Lagerwerf and Govaert hypothesized that 8 things in an online article’s headline would increase its clickthrough rate (clicks/impressions, abbreviate it to CTR below): consonance, eliteness, negativity, novelty, personalization, proximity, forward referencing, and language intensity (Lagerwerf & Govaert, 2021). They are briefly explained below.

-       Consonance: The title is linked to something that readers already know. The paper uses this as an example: “Also in death, Fidel divides the Cubans.”

-       Eliteness: The title mentions someone of high status or fame.

-       Negativity: The title is negative for the readers.

-       Novelty: The title is marked in this way if the event or issue reported is new or unexpected to the readers.

-       Personalization: The title includes a person’s personal experiences, such as eyewitness reports.

-       Proximity: The title is marked this way if the reported event or issue is geographically or culturally close to the reader.

-       Forward referencing: This consists of five variables that are added to form this variable. The five variables are titles with a demonstrative pronoun, titles with interrogative pronouns, titles with the Dutch word _Hier_, which refers to unknown places or situations, titles with the Dutch word _Zo_, which refers to unmentioned manners of doing, and titles with quotes without sources.

-       Language intensity: titles that include adjectives/adverbs/prefixes, compounds, nouns, or idioms that, if removed, do not change the title's meaning. Example: “The fat Irish duck is already Brexit’s victim.”

However, the results showed that only Negativity, Forward Feferencing, and Language Intensity increased CTR. (if these results is based on the literature, use present tense, but if it’s based on your findings, use past tense. So which is it?)

In another paper, Golan et al. (2008) discussed the application of “Taylor’s six-segment message strategy wheel” as a model to conduct content analysis of 360 viral ads. In this model, two basic advertising approaches are identified: the transmission view, which appeals to consumers’ cognition or logic (informational approach), and the ritual view, which appeals to emotions or senses (transformational approach). According to Taylor’s six-segment model, the transmission view is composed of three segments: ration, acute need, and routine, while the ritual view is composed of ego, social, and sensory segments.

The result of one of the research questions indicated that humor was by far the most commonly utilized advertising appeal in viral ads (91%). Sexuality was the second most common factor (> 28%). These advertising appeals were followed by the use of animals in ads (17.8%), violence (14.4%), and the use of children (12.8%) of all viral ads in the current analysis.

When you discuss different pieces of work, you should discuss how they interlink with each other. One way to do this is to compare similarities and differences, or adding on the topic with new insights—but whichever you use, you should “bridge” the ideas and form your holistic understanding of respective theory and the theories holistically.

# Shortcomings and concerns for existing solution

# The main problem is that both of these papers were researched in places far from Taiwan (Paper 1 in the Netherlands and Paper 2 in the United States), and important contexts such as cultural differences are ignored. Therefore, directly applying the solution found in other countries to NTU台大學生交流版 may not carry out ideal results.

# Research method: our comprehensive solution

To achieve our research objectives, there were three parts to our solution: data collection, analysis, and experimental validation.

1. Data Collection Techniques

○      We collected data from the NTU Facebook group through web scraping.

1. Analytical Techniques:

○      Textual data were analyzed using various methods, including keyword analysis and machine-learning-based semantic analysis.

○      Visual elements, such as images attached to posts, are also evaluated for their impact on post popularity.

1. Experimental Validation

○      An experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed strategies based on the patterns identified in the data analysis phase.

○      The experiment involved implementing the strategies gathered, along with our own hypothesis, and incorporating them into a questionnaire to validate our results and assumptions.

# In-depth Data Analysis: Unpacking the Findings

​​Graph 1: Reactions by Time Posted

The box plot illustrates the distribution of Facebook post reactions based on the time of day they were posted, highlighting significant variations in engagement levels. Posts made early in the morning, particularly around 2:00, received the fewest reactions, indicating low user activity during these hours. Mid-morning to early afternoon (8:00–13:00), there was a gradual increase in engagement. The afternoon hours displayed a steady user engagement rate, especially around 18:00, exhibiting the highest levels of engagement, with posts during this time frame garnering the most reactions and widest range of interactions. This analysis suggests that, to maximize engagement, posts should ideally be scheduled for early evening or late at night, while early morning hours should be avoided. Interesting!

​​Graph 2: Reactions by Prize Given

The scatter plot reveals how different types of prizes affect the engagement levels of Facebook posts of respondents completing a survey. Posts offering brownies from “coco.Brownies” and cash incentives show the highest engagement, with numerous posts reaching up to 300 reactions, indicating that these prizes are highly appealing to users. Posts featuring convenience store coupons garner moderate engagement, with approximately 50 reactions. On the other hand, StarBucks prizes exhibited the least engagement, with reactions clustering around the lower range. Overall, the analysis suggests that offering brownies or cash prizes is the most effective strategy for maximizing user participation and interaction, whereas convenience store coupons and Starbucks prizes are relatively less engaging.

The scatter plot examines the impact on engagementmeasured through reactions and comments, including specific keywords about prizes in the first line of Facebook posts. Posts that mentioned a prize in the initial line demonstrated significantly higher engagement, with a cluster of reactions reaching up to 200 reactions. These posts consistently outperform those that do not mention any keywords in the first line and exhibit a lower engagement rate. This trend implies that explicitly stating what prize will be provided if respondents complete a survey substantially enhances user interaction and engagement, making it a crucial tactic for maximizing post-effectiveness.

Experimental validation: questionnaire analysis

You should have include the screenshots of the ads you created to enhance your explanation.

1. Questionnaire creation:

○      There were ten questions in total. Every question is a comparison between two real posts of people  requesting survey respondents in NTU台大學生交流版. Each post has similar characteristics, with the only difference being that one may show a picture, while the other does not, or that the prizes differ. For the first seven questions, we implemented the data collected from the above analysis. For example, one post offered “coco.Brownies” as the prize, while the other offered Starbucks vouchers. See the following for a complete analysis of the results. As for the final three questions, we implemented three of our own hypotheses regarding what would make a post gain more reactions, with the same control variables as the seven other posts.

1. Result Analysis:

○      We received a total of 64 respondents, and the results were as follows:

1.     Posts with memes garner more reactions

2.     Pictures with cats are more engaging than pictures of dog

3.     The post clearly states the prize in its first sentence.

4.     The figure shows the prize.

5.     What the prize does not matter as long as there is a picture.

○      While most points are as expected and frankly trivial, point 5 is an interesting result. We discovered that on some posts, a single picture can neutralize the difference in appeal between a more valuable prize and a less valuable one.

Conclusion

The research conducted on the NTU台大學生交流版  has provided valuable insights into user engagement patterns and effective communication strategies. Through a meticulous analysis of post timing, prize incentives, and the impact of visual and textual elements, we identified the key determinants of successful content. Our findings suggest that posts made during the early evening, particularly those offering highly appealing prizes such as brownies or cash and incorporating visual elements of the prizes, significantly enhance user engagement. Additionally, the effective use of memes and images of cats has been confirmed to be a potent enhancer of interaction.

The experimental validation through questionnaires further corroborated our analysis, offering practical data-driven strategies to boost engagement. Interestingly, the discovery that any picture can mitigate the difference in engagement between more and less valuable prizes provides a better understanding of user behavior. These insights can be harnessed not only by students and small business owners but also by researchers aiming to spread their work broadly and effectively. By applying these tailored strategies, users can achieve significant societal and educational impacts in a crowded digital landscape.

# Potential Problems

Although our research offers concrete strategies for enhancing engagement, certain limitations and potential problems need to be addressed.

1. Temporal Relevance of Data: The collected data spanned several years. User engagement patterns may evolve and be influenced by changing digital behaviors, new platform features, or broader societal shifts. Continuous monitoring and updating of strategies are necessary to maintain their effectiveness.
2. Data Integrity and Sampling Bias: The data were collected via web scraping, which may not capture the full spectrum of user behaviors or the nuanced contexts of each post. In addition, the sample size for the questionnaire was relatively small (64 respondents), which may not provide a comprehensive representation of the entire user base of the NTU Facebook group.
3. Generalizability of Findings: Our experimental findings, while insightful, are based on specific hypotheses and a limited sample size. However, the generalizability of these results to all types of content and diverse user groups requires further validation.
4. Technical Restrictions: We unable to analyze the pictures attached to each post due to technical and time constraints. This is a major factor in the engagement of posts, as shown by the survey conducted. Further research on this topic should be conducted.

Addressing these potential problems involves ongoing research, adaptation of strategies as new data emerge, and perhaps developing scalable, resource-efficient methods that can be widely adopted. Further studies could also focus on expanding the sample size, considering more variables, and exploring engagement patterns in different cultural or demographic contexts within Taiwan and across other academic institutions.
