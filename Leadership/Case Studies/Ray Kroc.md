### Humble Beginnings

Ray Kroc was born in 1902 in Oak Park, Illinois. He had a variety of jobs—piano player, paper cup salesman, and most famously, a milkshake machine (Multimixer) salesman. He didn't become successful until his 50s, which already tells us something about his persistence.

### Discovering McDonald's

In 1954, while selling Multimixers, he noticed that a small restaurant in San Bernardino, California, had ordered _eight_ of them—suggesting they were making an unusual number of milkshakes. Curious, Kroc visited the McDonald brothers’ restaurant and was blown away by the efficiency of their system: a limited menu, speedy service, consistency, and cleanliness.

The McDonald brothers—Dick and Mac—had designed this system but weren’t interested in growing it too much. Kroc had bigger dreams.

### Building the Empire

Kroc convinced the brothers to let him franchise the concept. In 1955, he opened the first McDonald’s franchise in Des Plaines, Illinois, and founded **McDonald's Corporation**. He obsessively focused on consistency and scalability. Every burger, fry, and milkshake had to taste the same whether you were in Illinois or eventually Japan.

Kroc also pioneered **franchisee training** and created a system for how stores should be run. He even built “Hamburger University” to train McDonald's managers.

### The Business Move

Tensions grew with the McDonald brothers. Eventually, in 1961, Kroc bought them out for $2.7 million (roughly $26 million today)—enough to let them retire, but they later regretted the deal. The original McDonald’s location was not part of the deal and couldn’t even use the name—it became “The Big M” and was driven out of business by a new McDonald’s Kroc opened nearby.

It’s not the most ethical chapter of his story, but it reveals a key part of his personality: ruthless business instincts.

## What We Can Learn from Ray Kroc

### 1. It’s Never Too Late

Kroc was over 50 when he began building McDonald's into what it is today. In a world that glorifies young founders, his story reminds us that age is not a barrier to success.

### 2. Vision > Invention

Kroc didn’t invent the “fast food” concept. But he had the vision, persistence, and systems thinking to scale it. The idea was important—but execution and expansion were _everything_.

### 3. Obsess Over Quality and Consistency

He was meticulous about ensuring that every franchise followed the same rules. This consistency built customer trust, and eventually brand loyalty across the globe.

### 4. Franchising Done Right

Kroc’s model wasn’t just about selling rights—it was about training and support. His approach laid the foundation for modern franchising as a robust and scalable business model.

### 5. The Dark Side of Ambition

His fallout with the McDonald brothers reminds us of the ethical gray areas in business. Ambition can build empires, but it can also burn bridges. Whether you admire or critique Kroc, his story sparks important questions about the cost of success.

## Final Thought

Ray Kroc once said, _“If you’re not a risk taker, you should get the hell out of business.”_ His story is full of bold moves—some inspiring, others questionable. But in the end, he transformed a small hamburger joint into a cultural icon, showing that big dreams, when paired with execution and relentless drive, can reshape the world.
