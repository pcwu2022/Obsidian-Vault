### Cult
- Building a “cult-like” community
- [[Start with WHY|Simon Sinek: Golden Circle]]
- Focus on the *why*
- [[4MAT - WWHI]]
- **Why**
	- Why does the club exist?
	- What kind of impact do we want to make?
		- [[Influence]]
	- Focus on the *why* – everything begins with purpose.
	- The most important thing is the value we bring, not just our products or methods.
	- Vision gives direction and meaning; it's the north star that guides all actions and decisions.

	> Example: Instead of “we host events,” say “we empower youth through meaningful learning experiences.”

- [[Culture]] – Why is [[Culture]] important?
	- Team engagement and long-term commitment
	- Members are intrinsically motivated and proud of being part of the team
	- People grow with you
	- Legacy: people will pass down the culture and spirit to the next generation
	- **Autonomy**
		- Members operate autonomously with pride and ownership
		- People act out of intrinsic motivation [[內在生命]]
	- **Core [[Values]]** – Examples:
		- Members join because they share a common mission and passion
		- Conflict is natural, but we trust each other's intentions
		- *“You’re angry because you care.”*
		- No culture of blame or criticism after the fact
		- Culture of direct and effective communication: maximize output by minimizing misunderstandings

	> Example: A club member missing a task is not met with blame, but with a question—“Is there anything stopping you from completing this? Can I help?”

	- **Practices**
		- Radical transparency: all discussions and decisions are visible
		- Practices should align with core [[Values]]
		- Shared rituals reinforce the identity and [[values]] of the group

## How to build a highly productive team
- **[[開會|Meetings]] are toxic**
	- Promote a “no meeting” culture unless absolutely necessary
	- Ask: What is the *true cost* of a one-hour meeting with 8 people? (Time = Money)
	- Are meetings producing real results, or just consuming energy?
	- Replace meetings with text-based updates (asynchronous, transparent, efficient)
	- Spend time *Actually Doing Something* instead of just discussing

	> Example: Use a group chat thread or shared doc for updates and blockers.

- **[[OKR]] + Mind Maps**
	- *Objectives and Key Results*
		- **Objective** = clear, inspiring goal
		- **Key Results** = measurable outcomes (e.g., number of participants, engagement rate)
	- Use tools like ClickUp
		- Create Tickets, assign Tasks
	- Daily reflection: *Who is blocking my progress today?*

- **[[ICE Framework]]**
	- Evaluate tasks based on:
		- **Impact** – How much value will this create?
		- **Confidence** – How sure are we it will succeed?
		- **Effort** – How much effort does it require?
	- Prioritize tasks not by urgency, but by **value-effort-confidence tradeoff**
	- Blockers and incidents
		- Some tasks or events jump to the top of the priority list unexpectedly
		- These must be acknowledged and addressed, even if they weren’t in the original plan

	> Example: A member crisis or PR issue may need immediate attention, even if it wasn't on your to-do list.

## How to Communicate

- **Understand your why**
	- Always stay connected to your original intent and purpose

- **Empathy**
	- Understand the motivations behind others’ actions
	- When you show empathy, others feel seen, heard, and respected

	> Example: Ask “What’s going on in their world?” before reacting harshly.

- **Ownership**
	- A good leader takes responsibility—not just for results, but for people
	- Take initiative, say “I will take care of it”
	- Use “I” statements to show accountability
	- [[Peter Drucker’s management strategies]]

- **[[Trust]]**
	- Create a psychologically safe and trustworthy environment
	- It takes time, consistency, and intentional effort to build trust

- **Recommended Books**
	- *Trillion Dollar Coach*
	- [[How to win friends and influence people]]
	- [[Start with WHY]]

- **How to forecast the impact of a project**
	- Use the *Confidence* factor in the [[ICE Framework]]
	- Analyze others’ similar projects for success rate
	- Find secondary data to improve forecasting accuracy

- **How to identify your [[Target Audience]]**
	- Think: Who *would* or *might* come? Reach out to them directly.
	- Asking directly is often the fastest path to clarity
	- [[Customer]] [[Persona]]
		- Develop a profile of your typical TA (Target Audience)
		- Consider their needs, values, and behavior patterns

- **How to motivate a team with limited resources**
	- Club members may not have financial incentives—but passion and purpose still matter
	- Motivation without money is possible with:
		- Clear impact
		- Future vision and purpose
		- Personal growth and [[influence]] on others’ lives

	> Example: “I do this because I see how it changes people. That’s worth more than money.”

- **Communicating with superiors**
	- Understand what they care about
	- Test waters with small experiments
	- Frame your message in terms they value

	> Tip: Speak their language. Use their goals to anchor your [[pitch]].

- **As a leader, sometimes you must make tough decisions**
	- Passion without ability is not enough—you may need to let someone go for the team’s good
	- Compassion + Clarity = Fairness

- **When the team faces difficult times**
	- Encourage the team, acknowledge struggles
	- Set small, achievable goals to avoid feeling lost
		- [[The Law of Navigation]]
	- People leaving during hard times is normal—don’t take it personally
	- Always maintain **hope** and be the one who lights the way

	> Example: “Let’s just get through this week. One step at a time.”
