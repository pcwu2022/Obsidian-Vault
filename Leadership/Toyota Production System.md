The Toyota Production System (TPS) is a renowned manufacturing philosophy developed by Toyota that focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing efficiency. It's often referred to as "lean manufacturing" or a "Just-In-Time" system. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

**Core Principles:**

- **Elimination of Waste (Muda):**
    - TPS aims to identify and remove any activity that doesn't add value to the production process. This includes:
        - Overproduction
        - Waiting
        - Transportation
        - Excess processing
        - Inventory
        - Movement
        - Defects
        - Underutilization of Employees.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT):**
    - This principle emphasizes producing only what is needed, when it is needed, and in the quantity needed. This minimizes inventory and reduces waste.
    - The "Kanban" system is a key tool used in JIT to manage the flow of materials and information.
- **Jidoka (Autonomation):**
    - This involves automating processes with a human touch, enabling machines to detect defects and stop automatically.
    - It also empowers workers to stop the production line if they identify a problem, preventing defective products from moving further down the line.
- **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen):**
    - TPS promotes a [[culture]] of ongoing improvement, where everyone is encouraged to identify and implement small, incremental changes to enhance efficiency and quality.
- **Respect for People:**
    - TPS [[values]] its employees and emphasizes teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. It recognizes that people are the most valuable asset in the production process.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Kanban:**
    - A signaling system that controls the flow of materials through the production process.
- **Heijunka (Leveling):**
    - A technique for smoothing out production flow to minimize fluctuations in demand.
- **Genchi Genbutsu:**
    - "Go and see" - the principle of going to the source of a problem to understand it firsthand.

**Impact and [[Influence]]:**

- TPS has had a profound impact on manufacturing practices worldwide, and its principles have been adopted by businesses in various industries.
- It's considered the foundation of "lean" methodologies, which focus on efficiency and waste reduction.
