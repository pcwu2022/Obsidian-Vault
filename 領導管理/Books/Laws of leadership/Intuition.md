Leaders evaluate everything with a leadership bias

> A leader has to read the situation and know instinctively what play to call.
> People need a goal to galvanize them.
> Natural ability and learned skills create an informed intuition that makes leadership issues jump out at leaders.

### How leaders think

1. Leaders are readers of their situation
2. Leaders are readers of trends
3. Leaders are readers of their resources
4. Leaders are readers of people
5. Leaders are readers of themselves

> Leaders who want to succeed maximize every asset and resource they have for the benefit of their organization.
> What you see results from who you are.
> Who you are dictates what you see.

### Three level of leadership intuition

1. Those who naturally see it
2. Those who are nurtured to see it
3. Those who will never see it

> Whenever leaders find themselves facing a problem, they automatically measure it, and begin solving it.
> Improvement is impossible without a change in leadership.
> Leadership is more art than science.
