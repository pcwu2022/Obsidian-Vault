The RICE framework was first introduced by Sean McBride, a former product manager at Intercom. The framework adds an additional ‘Reach’ factor to the traditional ICE framework. Scoring is therefore based on Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort.

- R = Reach
- I = Impact
- C = Confidence
- E = Effort
- Score = (R x I x C) / E

|Factor|Description|
|---|---|
|Reach|How many people will this affect within a given period? Depending on your team or company goal, this could be the number of new visitors per month, or subscribers per quarter, or quote requests per year.|
|Impact|How much impact will this have on individual users? For example, how much could this change impact the quote request conversion rate? This is measured on a multiple choice scale:  <br>  <br>Massive impact = 3x  <br>High impact = 2x  <br>Medium impact = 1x  <br>Low impact = 0.5x  <br>Minimal impact = 0.25x|
|Confidence|What level of confidence do you have in your estimates? Do you have data to backup your prediction? Have you done something similar before, or know someone else that has?  <br>  <br>High confidence = 100%  <br>Medium confidence = 80%  <br>Low confidence = 50%|
|Effort|The total amount of time (typically in days) a project will require to make live. This should include any other teams that may need to be involved before it is launched – development, engineering, product marketing, product management etc.|
