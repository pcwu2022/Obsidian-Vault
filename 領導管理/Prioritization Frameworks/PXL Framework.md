The PXL framework was designed to address some of the perceived shortcomings of the more popular prioritization methods. Relatively simple frameworks such as [[ICE Framework]] and [[PIE Framework]] with just 3 scoring variables leave a lot that is open to interpretation and are often very subjective.

The CXL team set-out to design a more objective framework for experimentation using a set of 10 specific questions to score a test. It should be noted that whilst the initial template includes the specific questions below, the intention was for the framework to be a template that can be modified based on individual organizations and [[Needs]].

## How to use the PXL prioritization framework

The PXL model was initially developed for conversion optimization (CRO) projects, so whilst it is applicable to wider marketing and growth projects, it particularly lends itself well to identifying and prioritising underperforming pages for CRO activities.

|Question|Factor|Scoring|
|---|---|---|
|1|Is the change above the fold?|1 or 0|
|2|Is the change noticeable within 5 seconds?|2 or 0|
|3|Is the change adding or removing an element?|2 or 0|
|4|Is the change designed to increase user motivation?|1 or 0|
|5|Is the change running on high traffic page(s)?|1 or 0|
|6|Is the change addressing an issue discovered via user testing?|1 or 0|
|7|Is the change addressng an issues discovered via qualitative feedback?|1 or 0|
|8|Is the change addressing insights found via digital analytics?|1 or 0|
|9|Is the change supported by mouse tracking, heat maps or eye tracking?|1 or 0|
|10|Is the change easy to implement?|<4 hrs = 3, up to 8hrs = 2, under 2 days = 1, more =0|

## The PXL prioritization formula

We made this under the assumption of a binary scale – you have to choose one or the other. So for most variables (unless otherwise noted), you choose either a 0 or a 1.

But we also wanted to weight certain variables because of their importance – how noticeable the change is, if something is added/removed, ease of implementation. So on these variables, we specifically say how things change. For instance, on the Noticeability of the Change variable, you either mark it a 2 or a 0.

Ease factor in the framework – potential, importance, and ease – is assigned a score between 1 and 10 which is used to calculate the overall [[PIE Framework]] score.
