The PIE framework is a popular prioritization method that ranks tests based on three criteria: potential, importance, and ease. Using the PIE score, you can rank and prioritise all of your experiment ideas based on the average score of each of these criteria.

| Factor         | Description                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Potential**  | How big of an uplift do we estimate that the change will bring?                       |
| **Importance** | How much traffic does the page get and are you investing a lot to get those visitors? |
| **E**ase       | How simple is it to implement the fix?                                                |

The PIE framework is very similar to the [[ICE Framework]] (Impact, Confidence Ease) with the only change being the ‘_Confidence_‘ factor is substituted for ‘_Potential_‘.
