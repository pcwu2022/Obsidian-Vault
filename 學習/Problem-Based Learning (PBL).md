1. About PBL
2. An **active** approach
3. Learners **collaborate** to understand and solve **complex, ill-structured** problems

Well-structured v.s. Ill-structured problem:

Goal, problem space, path to solution, and information needed to solve it

1. Advantages:

i.   Transfer knowledge to new problems

ii.  Achieve a more clear and logical comprehension

1. PBL tutorial cycle

Ex: medical students learn from a case

1. Characteristics of successful PBL environments:

i.    Content integration across a range of disciplines

ii.   Collaboration and teamwork

iii.  Application and synthesis of new knowledge

iv.  Reflection on the learning process with self/peer assessment

v.   Real-world problems and issues

vi.  Examination processes

1. Why PBL is effective
2. 2 explanations:

**Activation-elaboration hypothesis:**

Activate prior knowledge → refine mental models

Later parts of the process build on earlier discussions and self-directed learning

**Situational interest hypothesis:**

Real-world problems arouse students’ interest → desire to seek out new info

1. Social interactions

Make their thinking visible

[[Negotiation]] and revision

1. Cognitive apprenticeship

i.  Makes the key aspects of expertise visible through questions that scaffold

student learning.

ii.  Facilitators help them model learning strategies, identify learning issues, and

realize the limit of their understanding

iii. Eventually fades back support

1. Formation of knowledge

External world (ex: white board) → internalize by individuals

1. Problems in PBL design

- The quality of problem is the basis for the success of PBL
- Often moderately ill structured
- Diagnostic, Design, Strategic, Decision-making
- Difficulty of a problem determines how willing the students will be to try to solve it.

1. Scaffolding

- Manage the complexity and group dynamic
- Temporary support

1. Communicating process

Build the structure

1. Coaching

Provide guidance while learners are performing the tasks.

Ex: highlight critical steps or ask questions

1. Eliciting articulation

Ask the students to explain

1. Approach:

i.    Teacher (guide active learning)

ii.   Representations (provide structure)

iii.  White board

External memory

Cleaning up the whiteboard (added, deleted)

1. Future directions

- Other disciplines and grades
- Assessment and Evaluation on process other than products
- Larger scales
