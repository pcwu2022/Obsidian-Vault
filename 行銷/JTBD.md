**JTBD (Jobs to Be Done)** is a framework that focuses on understanding customer needs by identifying the "job" a customer is trying to accomplish when they use a product or service. Rather than simply focusing on demographics or traditional segmentation, JTBD looks at the underlying motivations and tasks that drive customer behavior. The goal is to design or improve a product by addressing these core motivations effectively.

### Key Concepts in JTBD:
1. **Job**: The task or outcome that a customer aims to achieve, which can be functional, emotional, or social.
2. **Progress**: The improvement or transformation a customer seeks through a solution. For instance, hiring a rideshare service fulfills the job of "getting from A to B quickly and affordably."
3. **Context**: The specific situation in which the customer seeks to complete the job, including factors like location, timing, or urgency.
4. **Solutions**: Products or services that customers "hire" to get their job done. For example, someone may "hire" an energy drink to stay alert during a late-night study session.

### Example:
- **Job**: A busy parent wants to prepare a nutritious, quick breakfast for their kids on school mornings.
- **Solution**: This job could be addressed by breakfast bars, smoothies, or quick oats, each serving the job of "providing a nutritious breakfast in minimal time."

### How Startups Can Use JTBD:
1. **Identify Core Jobs**: Understand what key "jobs" customers need to get done that align with your product.
2. **Focus on Outcomes**: Design the product to meet specific customer outcomes and make the process simpler or more efficient.
3. **Differentiate**: Use JTBD insights to highlight what uniquely qualifies your product to fulfill these jobs better than competitors.
4. **Test and Iterate**: Continuously get customer feedback to ensure your product remains aligned with evolving jobs.

By focusing on the JTBD approach, startups can develop products that align closely with actual customer needs, leading to improved satisfaction, higher [[Retention]], and a stronger competitive edge.
