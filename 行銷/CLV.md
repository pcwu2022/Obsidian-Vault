**CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)** is a metric that estimates the total revenue a business can expect from a single customer throughout their entire relationship.
### How CLV is Calculated:

CLV = Average Purchase Value x Average Purchase Frequency x Customer Lifespan

- **Average Purchase Value**: The average amount a customer spends per transaction.
- **Average Purchase Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase within a specific time frame.
- **Customer Lifespan**: The average time a customer continues to buy from the business.
### Why CLV Matters for Startups:
1. **Budgeting for Acquisition**: Knowing CLV helps startups decide how much they can spend to acquire new customers without sacrificing long-term profitability.
2. **[[Retention]] Strategies**: Startups can focus on retaining high-value customers and improving customer loyalty to increase CLV.
3. **Personalized Marketing**: CLV insights allow startups to tailor marketing efforts to maximize the value of high-potential customers.
4. **Product Improvement**: Startups can identify which products or features are most profitable over the customer lifecycle, guiding product development priorities.

By maximizing CLV, startups can improve profitability, reduce [[Churn]], and build stronger relationships with their customer base.
