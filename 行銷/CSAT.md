**CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)** is a metric used to assess customer satisfaction with a product, service, or specific interaction. It’s usually measured through surveys that ask customers to rate their satisfaction on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5 or 1 to 10), where higher numbers indicate greater satisfaction.

### How CSAT is Calculated
CSAT= Total Number of Responses / Number of Satisfied Responses ×100

### Why CSAT is Important
1. **Quick Feedback**: CSAT provides immediate insights into customer satisfaction, helping businesses respond to issues promptly.
2. **Performance Tracking**: Monitoring CSAT over time helps companies evaluate service quality and make improvements.
3. **Customer Loyalty**: High CSAT scores are often linked to customer loyalty, as satisfied customers are more likely to return.

### CSAT Use Cases
- **Post-Purchase Feedback**: Companies like Amazon use CSAT surveys right after a purchase to gauge the shopping experience.
- **Customer Support**: CSAT surveys often follow customer service interactions, helping companies improve support quality.
- **Product Updates**: Product teams use CSAT to evaluate satisfaction with new features or updates.

### Limitations of CSAT
While CSAT is useful for immediate feedback, it doesn’t always capture long-term satisfaction or loyalty. To get a fuller picture, companies often use CSAT alongside other metrics like Net Promoter Score ([[NPS]]) and Customer Lifetime Value ([[CLV]]).
