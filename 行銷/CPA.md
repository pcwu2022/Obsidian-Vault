CPA, or **Cost Per Acquisition**: How much is spent to convert a user.

CPA = Total Cost of Campaign / Number of Acquisitions

For example, if a campaign costs $1,000 and results in 50 customer acquisitions, the CPA would be $20. Lower CPA values indicate more cost-effective campaigns, making CPA essential for budgeting and optimizing ad spend in startups and digital marketing.
