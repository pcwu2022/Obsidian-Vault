**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** is a key metric in startup marketing that represents the total cost a company spends to acquire a new customer. CAC includes marketing expenses, sales team costs, advertising, and any other expenses directly related to gaining new customers. CAC helps startups understand how efficiently they’re acquiring customers and whether their marketing and sales investments are sustainable over time.

### How CAC is Calculated:
CAC = Number of New Customers Acquired / Total Cost of Sales and Marketing​

### Usages of CAC in Startup Marketing:

1. **Budget Allocation**:
   - CAC helps startups decide how much to allocate to each marketing and sales channel based on how effectively it contributes to customer acquisition. If one channel has a much lower CAC than others, a startup may invest more in it to scale quickly.

2. **Profitability and Pricing Decisions**:
   - Startups use CAC to ensure that the cost of acquiring a customer is justified by the expected revenue from that customer. A profitable business model typically requires that **Customer Lifetime Value ([[CLV]])** exceeds CAC by a significant margin (often at least three times higher) to cover costs and ensure profitability.

3. **Channel Optimization**:
   - CAC can vary significantly by acquisition channel (e.g., social media ads vs. [[SEO]] vs. referral programs). By tracking CAC by channel, startups can identify which channels bring in cost-effective leads and optimize their strategies accordingly.

4. **Investor Attraction**:
   - A manageable and decreasing CAC is a strong indicator for investors. Startups that demonstrate an efficient and scalable acquisition model are more likely to attract investors who see sustainable growth potential.

5. **Product-Market Fit and Business Viability**:
   - A high CAC might indicate poor [[PMF]] if it’s challenging to acquire customers cost-effectively. Startups can use CAC to assess if their product resonates with the target market or if they need to adjust their approach.

6. **Improving Customer [[Retention]] and [[CLV]]**:
   - Understanding CAC also highlights the importance of [[Retention]] efforts. By improving customer loyalty and CLV, startups can afford a higher CAC and still be profitable, as each customer delivers more value over time.

### Example:
If a startup spends $10,000 on sales and marketing in a month and acquires 100 new customers, the CAC would be 100.

This means each new customer costs $100 to acquire. The startup would then compare this to the CLV of each customer to ensure the business model remains sustainable.
