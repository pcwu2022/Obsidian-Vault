### How NPS Works:
1. **Scoring Categories**:
   - **Promoters** (scores 9–10): Loyal customers who are enthusiastic and likely to refer others.
   - **Passives** (scores 7–8): Satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who might switch to competitors.
   - **Detractors** (scores 0–6): Unhappy customers who may damage brand reputation through negative word-of-mouth.

2. **NPS Calculation**:
   NPS = Promoters(%) - Detractors(%)
   A positive NPS suggests a loyal customer base, while a negative score indicates dissatisfaction.

### Importance of NPS for Startups:
- **Customer Loyalty Insight**: NPS helps startups gauge customer loyalty and satisfaction levels.
- **Actionable Feedback**: By following up with Detractors and Passives, startups can gather feedback to improve their offerings.
- **Benchmarking Growth**: NPS is useful for tracking customer sentiment over time, revealing trends in customer experience as the business scales.
- **Referrals and Growth**: High NPS scores indicate a strong likelihood of word-of-mouth referrals, a crucial growth factor for startups with limited marketing budgets.
