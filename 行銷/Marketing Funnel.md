The **marketing funnel** is a model that illustrates the customer journey from initial awareness of a product or service to making a purchase and beyond. 

1. **Awareness**: Customers first learn about the brand or product, often through ads, social media, or word-of-mouth.
2. **Interest**: Potential customers engage with content or seek more information, indicating a growing interest.
3. **Consideration**: Customers evaluate options, compare products, and assess benefits.
4. **Intent**: They show signs of intent to purchase, such as adding items to a cart or signing up for a free trial.
5. **Purchase**: The customer completes the purchase, becoming a paying customer.
6. **Loyalty**: After purchasing, efforts focus on retaining the customer through excellent service, personalized marketing, and rewards.
7. **Advocacy**: Loyal customers become advocates, recommending the product to others and helping attract new customers.

The funnel helps marketers create targeted strategies at each stage, optimizing conversions and building customer loyalty.
