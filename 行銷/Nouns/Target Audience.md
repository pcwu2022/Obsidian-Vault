### What Is a Target Audience?

A target audience is a specific group of consumers most likely to be interested in a product or service, and therefore the group that should see advertising campaigns. It can be defined by factors like age, gender, income, location, and interests.

### Types of Target Audiences

Target audiences can be categorized by interest, purchase intention, subcultures, and more:

- **Interest:** Grouping audiences by hobbies or entertainment preferences helps tailor personalized messaging, driving [[Brand]] loyalty.
- **Purchase Intention:** Identifying people looking for specific products helps address their [[Needs]] and pain points through targeted messages.
- **Subcultures:** Understanding subcultures (e.g., music genres or fandoms) helps connect with audiences by aligning with their motivations.

### Target Audience vs. Target [[Market]]

A target market refers to the broader set of consumers a company plans to reach, while a target audience is a specific segment within that market. The target audience is more refined and focused for specific ads, whereas a target market is broader.

### Roles of a Target Audience

It’s important to understand the roles consumers play in the buying process:
- **The Decision Maker:** The person who makes the final purchase decision, as in the case of women buying Old Spice for men in the 2010 campaign.
- **The Supporter:** A person who influences the purchase decision but does not make it, like children influencing their parents.

### 7 Ways to Determine Your Target Audience

1. **Analyze Your [[Customer]] Base:** Understand who already buys your product through surveys or social media engagements.
2. **Conduct Market Research:** Identify trends and gaps in the industry to better position your product.
3. **Analyze Competitors:** Study competitors’ audience to understand who they are targeting and how.
4. **Create Personas:** Build consumer personas to target different segments based on their specific demographics and [[Needs]].
5. **Define Who Your Audience Isn’t:** Avoid wasting resources by excluding groups unlikely to respond to your product.
6. **Continuously Revise:** Update your understanding of the target audience as new data emerges.
7. **Use Google Analytics:** Leverage data from Google Analytics to make data-driven decisions about your audience’s behavior.

### Creating Personas with the Right Demographics

Creating personas involves gathering information about your audience, including:
- Age, gender, location, hobbies, income, education level, profession, marital status
- Who they [[Trust]] and what they read or watch

### Reaching Your Target Audience

Once personas are created, you can use tools like:
- **Media Kits:** Publications' media kits provide detailed audience breakdowns.
- **Nielsen Ratings:** Nielsen's TV show ratings help identify viewership among certain demographics.
- **Social Media:** Platforms like Facebook and Instagram allow precise demographic targeting.

### How to Reach Your Audience at the Right Time

Targeting the right moment is just as important as the right audience:
- **Television:** Focus on ads at the beginning or end of commercial breaks for maximum visibility.
- **Radio:** Book ads at the start or end of radio breaks and pay attention to DMAs (Designated Market Areas).
- **Email:** Consider timing, such as avoiding Fridays for email blasts unless data suggests otherwise.

### Disadvantages of Target Audiences

While targeting is useful, brands should not overlook new opportunities. Repositioning the [[brand]] or uncovering unexpected product use cases through analytics can help capitalize on missed opportunities.
