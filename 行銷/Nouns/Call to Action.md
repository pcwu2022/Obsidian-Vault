A **Call to Action (CTA)** is a prompt in marketing that encourages users to take a specific action, like clicking a button, signing up, purchasing, or downloading. CTAs are designed to guide users toward the next step in their interaction with a product or service, often leading to conversions.

Effective CTAs are clear, action-oriented, and create a sense of urgency or value. Examples include phrases like "Sign Up Now," "Get Started," "Download Free," or "Learn More." 

CTAs are crucial in digital marketing, as they direct user behavior, improve engagement, and help measure campaign success.
