**Churn** refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given period. It’s a critical metric for any business, especially for subscription-based or service-oriented companies, as high churn rates can signal customer dissatisfaction and a potential need to improve product, service, or customer experience.

### Why Churn Matters
1. **Revenue Impact**: Churn directly affects a company’s revenue, as losing customers means lost revenue opportunities.
2. **Customer Retention**: Tracking churn helps businesses understand how well they’re retaining customers and whether they need to adjust retention strategies.
3. **Business Health Indicator**: High churn rates can indicate underlying issues, such as product-market fit problems, high competition, or ineffective customer engagement.

### Types of Churn
- **Customer Churn**: When customers leave or stop using a service entirely.
- **Revenue Churn**: Measures the revenue lost when high-value customers leave or downgrade their plans.
  
### Calculating Churn
To calculate churn, divide the number of customers lost during a period by the total number of customers at the start of that period. Multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage. 

For instance, if a company starts the month with 200 customers and loses 10 by the end, the monthly churn rate would be 5%.

### Strategies to Reduce Churn
1. **Improve Customer Support**: Ensuring fast, efficient, and friendly customer service can help reduce churn by resolving issues that may lead to cancellations.
2. **Increase Product Value**: Regularly improving products and adding new features can keep customers engaged and satisfied.
3. **Customer Feedback**: Actively collecting and implementing customer feedback allows businesses to address pain points before they lead to churn.
4. **Loyalty Programs**: Rewarding long-term customers through discounts or special access can increase loyalty and reduce churn.

### Example
A streaming service like Netflix closely monitors its churn rate, as retaining subscribers is essential to sustaining growth. By analyzing why subscribers cancel, Netflix can implement better features, personalized content, and competitive pricing to keep customers engaged.
