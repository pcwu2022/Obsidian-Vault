**ARPU**, or **Average Revenue Per User**: The average revenue generated per user or customer over a specific period.

ARPU = Total Revenue / Number of Active Users

For example, if a company earns $100,000 from 10,000 active users in a month, the ARPU would be $10. ARPU helps businesses understand revenue growth per user and make informed decisions on pricing strategies, customer acquisition, and product development. A higher ARPU generally indicates more effective monetization.
