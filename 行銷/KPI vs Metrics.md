The terms **[[KPI]] (Key Performance Indicator)** and **[[Metrics]]** are both used to measure performance, but they serve different purposes and have different levels of importance in evaluating business success.

### Key Differences:

| Aspect         | KPI (Key Performance Indicator)                                                            | Metrics                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | A KPI is a critical measure directly linked to strategic business goals or objectives.     | A metric is any measurable value that shows the status of a particular business process.             |
| **Purpose**    | KPIs indicate the overall success of core objectives and are directly tied to performance. | Metrics track routine, day-to-day activities and are not necessarily linked to strategic objectives. |
| **Examples**   | Revenue growth rate, customer [[Retention]] rate, Net Promoter Score ([[NPS]]), [[CLV]]        | Website traffic, number of social media likes, email open rate, page views                           |
| **Importance** | KPIs are high-level indicators used by leadership to make strategic decisions.             | Metrics are lower-level indicators used to monitor and optimize specific activities.                 |
| **Scope**      | KPIs are more limited in number and chosen to reflect business priorities.                 | Metrics can be numerous and cover many different aspects of business performance.                    |

### How They Work Together:
- **KPIs** rely on specific **metrics** to track progress. For example, if customer [[Retention]] rate is a KPI, supporting metrics could include metrics like average customer tenure, repeat purchase rate, and [[Churn]] rate.
- Metrics provide **detailed insight** into specific areas, allowing teams to make data-driven adjustments that contribute to higher-level KPI performance.

In summary, KPIs are strategic indicators that reflect business goals, while metrics are broader measurements that provide insights into various business processes. Both work together to provide a comprehensive view of performance.
