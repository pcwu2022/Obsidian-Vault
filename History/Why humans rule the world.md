### The Power of Collective Cooperation

- Unlike other animals, humans can coordinate and work together with countless strangers.
- Ants and bees cooperate in rigid structures, while wolves and chimpanzees cooperate only in small, familiar groups.
- In contrast, humans can form large-scale cooperative networks beyond personal acquaintances.

### The Role of Imagination in Human Cooperation

- The ability to create and believe in shared fictions allows mass cooperation.
- Examples of such fictions include religion, human rights, nations, and money.
- These constructs do not exist in objective reality but are powerful because large groups of people believe in them.
- This ability distinguishes humans from other animals, enabling the formation of legal, political, and economic systems.

### The Influence of Fictional Entities

- Religious beliefs and human rights exist only in collective imagination.
- Nations and economies function based on shared narratives, not physical realities.
- Money is the most successful fictionâ€”its value relies entirely on widespread belief.
- Even ideological opponents recognize and use money, proving its universal acceptance.

### Conclusion

Humans live in a dual reality: one of objective elements (rivers, trees, animals) and another of imagined constructs (nations, laws, money). These fictional entities now shape the world, influencing the fate of real-world elements like forests and wildlife. The human capacity to believe in and act upon shared myths is the foundation of our global dominance.
