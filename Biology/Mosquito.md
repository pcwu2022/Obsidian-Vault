### General Information
- **Mosquito**: Derived from the Spanish word *Musketas*, meaning "small fly."
- Found worldwide except in Arctic and Antarctic regions.
- Over 3,500 species and subspecies, divided into 38 genera.
- Vectors for diseases like dengue fever, yellow fever, and malaria.

#### Medical Importance
- **Genera of Concern**:
  - **Culex**: ~90 species
  - **Aedes**: ~700 species
  - **Anopheles**: ~460 species
- **Anopheles gambiae**: Deadly species in sub-Saharan Africa, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths yearly from malaria.

#### Mosquito Life Cycle
- **Larvae (wrigglers)**: Feed on microorganisms in water; surface or bottom feeders.
- **Pupae**: Aquatic, do not feed, take in air through respiratory trumpets.
- Larval development: 5-14 days.

#### Fun Facts
- Only female mosquitoes bite.
- Can drink up to three times their weight in blood.
- Have been around since the Jurassic period.
- Bites cause bumps due to their saliva.

#### History and Impact
- Malaria evidence found in ancient mummies from Thebes, Egypt.
- Yellow fever epidemic in 1793 Philadelphia killed 10% of the city’s population.
- Mosquitoes have influenced major historical events, including the death of Alexander the Great and the construction of the Panama Canal.

#### Methods to Control Mosquitoes
- **Sterile Insect Technique**: Releasing sterile males to prevent reproduction.
- **Insecticide-Treated Bed Nets**: Effective for malaria mosquitoes but not for Aedes mosquitoes (daytime feeders).
- **Genetically Modified Mosquitoes**: Lab-modified mosquitoes released to reduce populations.
  
#### Related Research
- Mosquitoes’ **olfactory system** studied for developing traps/poisons.
- Studies on blocking disease transmission through bacteria like *Wolbachia*.

#### Global Warming & Mosquitoes
- Mosquitoes thrive at temperatures above 50°F.
- Global warming may lead to increased mosquito activity in many areas.

#### Mosquitoes & Blood Types
- Prefer type O blood; heat and CO₂ emissions also attract them.
- Pregnant women are more prone to bites due to higher CO₂ levels.

#### Miscellaneous
- **Largest Mosquito**: An 18-foot metal statue located in Lehigh Acres, Florida.
- Mosquitoes have receptors that detect human breath (CO₂) and body heat.
- Hibernation: Female mosquitoes double their weight in sugars to survive winters.
