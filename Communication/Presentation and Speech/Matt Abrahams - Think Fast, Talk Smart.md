## Introductory Ideas

- Spontaneous speaking is more common than planned speaking. (Introductions, feedback, toasts, Q&A etc.) But it is also more challenging than presentations.
- Majority of us are not as effective as we can be in spontaneous thinking and speaking, especially in public speaking. But we have in our ability the tools and approaches to communicate effectively.
- We become effective communicators by actually communicating (doing).
- Secrets to effective communication: Approach, attitude, practice. 1% improvements in these domains make a big difference in driving impact.

## How do we manage anxiety when communicating?

- Your first job as a public speaker is to make your audience comfortable so they can receive the message properly.
- Everyone can manage their fear of public speaking. How?
	1. Greet/Acknowledge [[Anxiety on Communication|Anxiety]]. Acknowledge your anxiety first to stem the tide of anxiety spiraling out of control.
	2. Reframe how you see the situation: View presentation as a conversation, not a performance! Performance has right and wrong rules, but conversation is more natural. There is no “one right way” to converse.
- How to reframe the situation?
- Start with questions. Questions are dialogic (Two way). They get the audience involved, as if in conversation.
- Use conversational language. Many nervous speakers distance themselves conversationally with pronouns they use.
- Be present-oriented: Focus on the present, not future consequences. Don’t anticipate what to say. Try tongue twisters.
- Warm up your voice: Most nervous speakers don’t warm up their voice. They retreat into their heads.

## How to Feel Comfortable Speaking in Spontaneous Situations

### Step 1: Get out of our own way.

- We want to be perfect when speaking spontaneously.
- Our brain tends to “stockpile” what to say/what to act before the moment, and act in patterns. This is wired deeply into us as muscle memory.
- Train yourself to respond, not to react. Responding is authentic, while reacting is pre-empting/muscle memory.
- Dare to be dull by responding, not reacting.

### Step 2: See the speaking/presentation/communication as an opportunity, not a threat.

- Most people see communication as adversarial. “Me against them”.
- Change your perspective to an opportunity, not a threat.
- Spontaneous speaking situations are one that afford you opportunities and to have fun.
- A better mentality/approach to take: “Yes, and” instead of “No, but”

### Step 3: Slow down and listen.

- Understand the demands of requirements you find yourself in to respond appropriately.
- Your fundamental job as a communicator is to be in service of the audience. Understand their [[needs]] by listening.
- You must focus and listen (Truly understand what the person is trying to say).
- Listen, and then respond.

### Step 4: Respond by telling a story.

- Never lose your audience! Keep your audience on track with structure.
- All stories have structure. Telling stories help structure your response.
- [[Speech Structure|Structure]] increases the effectiveness of how we process information.
- Useful structure 1: Problem/Opportunity → Solution → Benefit
- Useful structure 2: What? → So what? (Why it’s important) → Now what? (Next steps)
- In a spontaneous speaking session, you must immediately figure out what to say and how to say it. Structures help you figure out how to say something.
- Structure sets you free.

## What are some communication questions from the audience? (Q&A)

- How do you deal with hostile communication situations?
	- You shouldn’t be taken by surprise. Before you even speak or enter the room, think about what the environment would be like.
	- First, acknowledge the emotion and idea. Do not name the emotion (lest it leads to even more conflict/misunderstanding), just acknowledge.
	- Next, reframe and respond in a way that makes sense (explain).
- How do you communicate or present remotely?
	- Try to include various engagement techniques where the audience has to participate/do something.
	- Examples: Polling questions, collaborative documents (Google Doc, Wiki etc.), or inviting imagination.
- How do you buy time to think before answering a question?
	- Paraphrase the question.
	- The Paraphrase is the Swiss army knife of communication. It buys you time to reframe and think about the answer, ensuring you get it right.
- Should we use humor in presentations?
	- Humor is a great tool for connection) but very, very risky.
- What if people find it inappropriate? Or unfunny?
	- Self-deprecating humor is your best bet.
- How do you prevent yourself from sounding ignorant?
	- Ask “Why do you say that?”, or “How do you feel about that?”
	- Ask them to give advice. Advice changes the relationship people have with the question asker.
	- Be mindful about Cultural Differences and [[Know Your Audience]] and their cultural expectations.
