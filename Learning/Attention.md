Vernacchia (2003) defined concentration simply as “the ability to perform with a clear and present focus” (p. 144). What then is focus? Focus has been defined as the central point of one's attention. Attention is simply what an individual is observing. When put together, an individual who is concentrating is said to have their attention focused clearly and presently on the task at hand.

在定義注意力(Attention)時經常遇到不同模糊甚至是矛盾的定義。但 Attention is the flexible control of limited computational resources.注意力是對有限計算資源的靈活控制。

It has been studied in conjunction with many other topics in neuroscience and [[psychology]] including awareness, vigilance, saliency, executive control, and learning.

注意力的研究由心理學開始，設計良好的行為實驗可以展現不同情況下注意力的傾向和能力。認知神經學和認知心理學則希望可以建立模組turn these observations into models of how mental processes could create such behavioral patterns.

The influence of single-cell neurophysiology in non-human primates along with non-invasive means of monitoring human brain activity such as EEG, fMRI, and MEG have made direct observation of the underlying neural processes possible. From this, computational models of neural circuits have been built that can replicate certain features of the neural responses that relate to attention

### Types of Attention

Attention is a complex process that we use in almost all of our daily activities. Over time, scientists and researchers have found out that attention is not a single process, but rather a group of attention sub-processes. The most accepted model for the attention sub-components is currently the hierarchical model from Sohlberg and Mateer (1987, 1989), which is based on clinical cases of experimental neuropsychology. According to this model, attention can be divided into the following parts:

- Arousal: Refers to our activation level and level of alertness, whether we are tired or energized.
- Focused Attention: Refers to our ability to focus attention on a stimulus.
- Sustained Attention: The ability to attend to a stimulus or activity over a long period of time.
- Selective Attention: The ability to attend to a specific stimulus or activity in the presence of other distracting stimuli.
- Alternating Attention: The ability to change focus attention between two or more stimuli.
- [Divided Attention](https://www.cognifit.com/science/cognitive-skills/divided-attention): The ability to attend different stimuli or attention at the same time.
### Attentional Systems and Neuroanatomy

According to the neuroanatomical model from Posner and Petersen (1990), there are three different attentional systems. They are the following:

- Reticular Activating System (RAS) or Alert System: This system is mainly in charge of Arousal and Sustained Attention. It is closely related to the reticular formation and some of its connections, like the frontal areas, limbic systems, the thalamus, and the basal ganglia.
- Posterior Attentional System (PAS) or Orientation System: This system is in charge of Focused Attention and Selective Attention of visual stimuli. The brain areas related to this system are the posterior parietal cortex, the lateral pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and the superior colliculus.
- Anterior Attentional System (AAS) or Execution System: This system is in charge of Selective Attention, Sustained Attention, and Divided Attention. It's closely related to the prefrontal dorsolateral cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the supplementary motor area, and with the neostriatum (striate nucleus).

Continuous Performance Test (CPT), the classic Stroop test, the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA), and the Hooper Visual Organization Task (VOT). This test helps to evaluate other behavioral alterations, response time, visual perception, shifting, inhibition, updating, spatial perception, processing speed, visual scanning, and hand-eye coordination

The visual T.O.V.A. uses two simple geometric figures and involves clicking the micro switch when the person taking the test sees the target figure and not clicking when it's the non-target figure. The visual T.O.V.A. may be presented in several different ways, but the most common test displays the target as a square with a second but smaller square inside of it near the upper border. The non-target is a square with the smaller square near the lower border
