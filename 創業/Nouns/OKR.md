OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a goal-setting methodology that helps teams define measurable goals. Created by John Doerr, OKRs tie your objectives (what you aim to achieve) with key results (how youâ€™ll measure progress), linking high-level goals to everyday tasks. This method enhances employee engagement and goal alignment by establishing clear and ambitious goals. 

### Key OKR Elements:
- **Objective:** The goal to be achieved (e.g., improve brand awareness).
- **Key Result:** The measurable outcome showing progress (e.g., reach 1 million web visitors).

### OKRs vs. [[KPI]]s:
- **OKRs** focus on setting and achieving broader goals. They use key results as progress indicators, which can be qualitative or quantitative.
- **KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators) track specific project or initiative performance. Some KPIs can serve as KRs within OKRs, particularly when the results are highly quantifiable.

Both frameworks have unique benefits, but starting with OKRs provides a comprehensive approach to connect individual contributions with organizational goals and motivate teams toward impactful outcomes.
