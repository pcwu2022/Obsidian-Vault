> 描述一個組織如何創造、傳遞及獲取價值的手段與方法 -- 獲利世代

- 創造價值 [[Create Value]]
- 傳遞價值
- 獲取價值

## Why design?
- 同樣的產品，怎麼賣、怎麼收錢、跟誰收錢，結果會有差

## Examples
- ex: 飛利浦，將照明視為一個 Service 而非 Product
	- 永續發展 -> 客戶通常不知道怎麼回收這個產品
	- 因此，飛利浦將 "照明" 視為一個服務，有照明需求的公司付錢給飛利浦，剩下由飛利浦完成
	- 找到 [[痛點]]
- ex: Adobe Creative Cloud [[平台]] 從實體到數位
	- Shift from perpetual licensing to a subscription-based **SaaS model** (Creative Cloud).
	- Expansion into **cloud-based services** (Experience Cloud, Document Cloud).
	- Focus on **digital transformation** for businesses (marketing, analytics, content management).
	- Integration of **AI and automation** through **Adobe Sensei**.
	- Diversification into new markets (acquisitions of Magento, Marketo for e-commerce and marketing).
	- Building a strong **ecosystem and community** (Adobe Stock, Behance).
	- Support for **remote work** and digital-first strategies, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
- ex: Nespresso 開啟多種通路
	- **Vertically integrated system**: Nespresso developed its own machines and capsules, creating a closed ecosystem that locks customers into using Nespresso products.
	- **Subscription services**: Offering coffee subscriptions for convenience and customer loyalty.
	- **Premium positioning**: Branding itself as a luxury coffee experience with high-quality beans and a sleek design.
	- **Sustainability initiatives**: Focus on recycling capsules, sustainable sourcing, and environmental efforts.
	- **Direct-to-consumer model**: Through boutiques, online [[Channels]], and personalized customer service to enhance the premium experience.
- ex: Google / Facebook 免費商業模式
	- **Ad-driven revenue**: Both platforms offer free services to users while generating revenue through targeted advertising. They collect user data to show personalized ads based on interests, behaviors, and demographics.
	- **User data monetization**: They leverage vast amounts of user data to optimize ad targeting, improving the effectiveness of ads and charging advertisers based on [[Metrics]] like clicks and impressions.
	- **Ecosystem expansion**: By providing free tools (Google Search, Gmail, Facebook’s social platform), they attract users, keeping them within their ecosystems to drive more ad impressions and engagement.
- ex: Netflix
	- **Subscription-based model**: Users pay a recurring monthly fee for unlimited access to a vast library of streaming content, with different pricing tiers based on features like HD quality and multiple devices.
	- **Original content production**: Heavy investment in **Netflix Originals** (movies, shows, documentaries) to reduce reliance on third-party content and differentiate from competitors.
	- **Global expansion**: Offering localized content and services in multiple countries to tap into international markets.
	- **Data-driven recommendations**: Using user data and algorithms to personalize content recommendations, improving user engagement and [[Retention]].
	- [[AB Testing]]
	- 利用大數據更新演算法，當使用者愈多，Data 愈多，演算法愈好 -> 飛輪效應
