Steve Jobs often used **two-axis charts** (or **quadrants**) to simplify complex ideas during his presentations. These charts usually have two axes, with each axis representing contrasting qualities or attributes. Jobs strategically used these visuals to clearly position products or ideas relative to each other, making abstract comparisons or decisions feel simple and intuitive for his audience.

### How Two-Axis Charts Work:
- **X-axis**: Represents one dimension, often a specific attribute such as "ease of use" or "functionality."
- **Y-axis**: Represents another contrasting attribute, like "affordability" or "quality."
- The quadrants formed by the intersection of these axes categorize products, services, or concepts into four distinct groups based on their relative performance on both axes.

### Why These Charts Are Useful:
- **Simplify Complex Decisions**: They visually break down multifaceted problems into manageable parts.
- **Highlight Trade-offs**: They make it easier to see how different variables interact and which trade-offs are required.
- **Improve Strategic Planning**: They guide companies in product positioning, market strategies, and operational efficiency.
- **Enhance Communication**: Visual representations help align team members or stakeholders around strategic decisions.
