The **Lean Canvas** is a simplified, one-page business plan template designed for startups and entrepreneurs. It was adapted from the [[Business Model Canvas]] by Ash Maurya to focus more on early-stage startups and their key assumptions. The goal is to quickly and efficiently document and validate a business idea without needing a full, formal business plan.

### Key Sections of the Lean Canvas

1. **Problem**:
   - Identify the top 1–3 problems that your target customers face.
   - You want to validate whether these problems are real and significant enough to build a business around.
   - [[What's Your Problem]]
   - Existing Solutions:  客戶不在乎有甚麼 SPEC，而是[[痛點]]有沒有夠痛，有沒有其他替代方案？

2. **Customer Segments**:
   - Who are the different customer groups you are targeting? 
   - These could include different demographics, job roles, or behavioral segments.
   - This section also includes the **early adopters** — the first people who will use your product or service.
	- Early Adopters: 要改變消費者的使用習慣是很困難的
	- [[Technology Adoption Lifecycle]]

3. **Unique Value Proposition ([[UVP]])**:
   - A clear, concise statement that explains what differentiates your product or service from competitors.
   - It answers the question, “Why should customers choose you over others?”
   - The [[UVP]] is crucial for grabbing attention and making your offering compelling.

4. **Solution**:
   - Outline the top 1–3 features or solutions that directly address the identified problems.
   - At this stage, your solution is just a hypothesis; you’ll refine it based on customer feedback.

5. **[[Unfair Advantage]]**:
   - What sets you apart from the competition that cannot easily be copied or bought?
   - This could be a unique technology, proprietary data, [[brand]] loyalty, or a key partnership.

6. **Revenue Streams**:
   - How will you make money?
   - Define your pricing model, potential revenue sources, and how each customer segment will contribute to revenue.

7. **Cost Structure**:
   - Identify the key costs involved in operating your business.
   - This includes fixed and variable costs, such as salaries, marketing, operational expenses, and software tools.
   - [[Income Statement]]

8. **Key [[Metrics]]**:
   - Define the key performance indicators ([[KPI]]s) that you will track to measure success.
   - Examples include user acquisition, customer [[Retention]], revenue growth, and other actionable metrics.
   - [[AARRR]]

9. **[[Channels]]**:
   - Identify how you will reach your customer segments.
   - These could include both online and offline [[Channels]] such as social media, direct sales, [[SEO]], email marketing, partnerships, etc.

### Why Use a Lean Canvas?

- **Focus**: The canvas focuses on the essential elements of a startup, helping entrepreneurs think about the critical assumptions and risks.
- **Clarity**: It’s visually simple and easy to understand, making it useful for pitching ideas to investors or team members.
- **Flexibility**: As your business evolves, the Lean Canvas can be easily updated and refined.
