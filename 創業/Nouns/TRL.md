Technology Readiness Level

vs. [[Product Development Model]]

The **Technology Readiness Model** (also known as **Technology Readiness Levels**, or **TRLs**) is a framework used to assess the maturity of a particular technology. It helps businesses, researchers, and organizations understand how far along a technology is in its development cycle, from initial concept to full deployment and commercialization.

The model was originally developed by NASA in the 1970s to assess the maturity of space technologies, but it has since been adapted across various industries, including defense, aerospace, energy, and manufacturing.

### Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)
TRLs are typically divided into **nine levels**, each representing a different stage of development:

---

### **TRL 1: Basic Research**
- **Description**: This is the initial stage of technology development. Basic scientific research begins, and fundamental principles are observed and reported. There is no practical application at this stage, and the focus is on theory.
- **Example**: Discovery of a new material with unique properties.

### **TRL 2: Concept Formulation**
- **Description**: Once basic principles are established, the technologyâ€™s potential application is hypothesized. Research may begin to understand how the discovery can be applied, but practical use is not yet proven.
- **Example**: Early-stage research to apply the new material in energy storage.

### **TRL 3: Experimental Proof of Concept**
- **Description**: At this stage, analytical studies and laboratory research are conducted to validate that the concept is feasible. Proof-of-concept models or early-stage prototypes may be developed.
- **Example**: Creating a lab-scale [[Prototype]] of the energy storage device using the new material.

### **TRL 4: Technology Validation in Laboratory**
- **Description**: The technology is tested in a controlled lab environment to demonstrate that it can perform its intended function. This stage includes developing a working prototype or system.
- **Example**: Successfully demonstrating the energy storage prototype in a controlled lab setting.

### **TRL 5: Technology Validation in Relevant Environment**
- **Description**: The technology is validated in a relevant (non-laboratory) environment that more closely resembles real-world conditions. The goal is to refine the prototype for practical use.
- **Example**: Testing the energy storage system in a simulated environment, like a test facility that mimics operating conditions.

### **TRL 6: Technology Demonstration in Relevant Environment**
- **Description**: The technology is now more advanced, and the system is demonstrated in an environment that accurately represents actual operating conditions, though still not in full-scale.
- **Example**: Demonstrating the energy storage system in a renewable energy project at a smaller scale.

### **TRL 7: System Prototype Demonstration in Operational Environment**
- **Description**: A full-scale prototype of the system is created and demonstrated in an operational environment. The technology is approaching commercialization readiness, but further refinement is still required.
- **Example**: Deploying the energy storage system on a pilot basis within a commercial energy grid to test under real-world conditions.

### **TRL 8: Actual System Completed and Qualified**
- **Description**: The technology has been developed to the point of full operational readiness. It has passed final testing and is now ready for commercial use or deployment.
- **Example**: The energy storage system is fully integrated into a commercial energy grid and is performing reliably under normal operating conditions.

### **TRL 9: Full Commercial Deployment**
- **Description**: The technology has been proven to work as expected in an operational environment and is now commercially available for widespread use. The focus shifts to scaling and optimizing production.
- **Example**: The energy storage technology is now available for purchase and widely used in the energy industry.

### Importance of the Technology Readiness Model
- **Assessment of Risks**: TRLs help organizations assess the risks associated with a new technology. The lower the TRL, the greater the uncertainty about its eventual success.
- **Resource Allocation**: The model guides decision-makers on where to allocate resources, helping them invest in technologies that are closer to commercialization.
- **Collaboration**: It encourages collaboration between researchers, engineers, and business units by providing a common language for discussing technology maturity.
- **Funding Decisions**: Investors and governments often use TRLs to decide which technologies to fund, focusing on those that are more mature or have higher potential for commercial success.

The Technology Readiness Model is a widely used tool that allows stakeholders to gauge how close a technology is to reaching the [[Market]], helping to align research, development, and investment efforts.
