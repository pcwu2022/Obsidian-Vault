The purpose of a startup accelerator is exactly that — to accelerate your startup’s growth. It’s a mentor-based program that provides intensive guidance, support and structure for a set period of time, typically three months. 

When you apply to a startup accelerator program, you are expected to have more than an idea — ideally a prototype or an actual product. You’ll gain exposure to a wide range of [advisors](https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/startup-strategy/building-startup-advisory-board/) and experienced entrepreneurs who’ll help you develop your product, hone your [[Business Model]] and — most importantly — connect with [investors](https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/startup-strategy/what-investors-look-for-povs-from-the-other-side-of-the-table/). The goal is “demo day” when you’ll present your idea to potential investors and other interested parties, including the press.

## What is a startup accelerator? 

There are over 200 accelerator programs in the United States — many more globally — and they differ in approach, focus, cost and effectiveness. The well-respected [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and SVB’s partner, [Techstars](https://www.techstars.com/), are investor funded and work primarily with tech startups. Others are sponsored by universities, in the case of [Stanford University’s StartX](https://www.startx.com/), or by corporations — the latter is particularly true for healthcare startups. 

Private startup accelerators can provide funding, and the money helps cover early-stage business expenses as well as travel and living expenses for the three-month residency at the in-person startup accelerators. However, the funds and guidance come at a price. Just like any other equity funding, signing an accelerator agreement typically means [giving up a slice of your company](https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/startup-equity/startup-equity-dilution/). Startup accelerators generally take 5% to 10% of your equity in exchange for training and a relatively small amount of funding.

[Are startup accelerators worth it?](https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/raising-capital/startup-accelerator-right-for-you/) For most startups, the overwhelming answer is yes. First-time founders usually need a lot of support, and an accelerator can help you by: 

- Providing a playbook from past startups 
- Making connections to investors 
- Explaining the best ways to [[pitch]]  
- Showing what a fund-raising cycle looks like 

Accelerators can also connect you to subject matter experts to help you achieve product/[[Market]] fit or even help you develop a go-to-[[Market]] plan.  

Success stories abound. “I’m not sure we would have made it without Techstars,” says [EverTrue](https://www.evertrue.com/) co-founder and CEO, Brent Grinna. In the years following its participation in the startup accelerator program, the company raised roughly $25 million in venture funding. 

However, you need to choose carefully so you don’t end up giving away your time and [equity](https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/raising-capital/understanding-startup-cap-table/) in exchange for off-the-shelf help. While top programs boast of a large roster of well-known graduates, the number of [successful exits](https://www.growthmentor.com/blog/best-startup-accelerators/) and [amounts raised](https://www.seed-db.com/accelerators) drop off rapidly, according to reports in GrowthMentor and Seed-DB.

## What do startup accelerators offer businesses? 

In addition to limited financial support, there are four major areas in which tech startup accelerators can help you take a company from idea to launch. 

**1. Startup accelerators can provide critical connections.**   

Well known accelerators work closely with [angel investors](https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/raising-capital/how-to-find-the-right-angel-investors/) and venture capital firms that are looking to invest in promising business ideas. Additionally, “an accelerator can very quickly introduce you to a ton of people,” says serial entrepreneur Michael Wolfe. If you are new to the industry, this is particularly useful. “By connecting you to a lot of advisors, you quickly become part of the [[culture]] and [develop a network](https://www.svb.com/startup-insights/startup-strategy/two-emails-every-early-stage-founder-should-master/) in a year that it would otherwise take 10 years to create,” he says. Being a member of this insider network, he adds, also gives you credibility which will help with both hiring and fundraising.    

**2. Startup accelerators can provide invaluable business and management mentoring.**   

They can match inexperienced founders with the right management team to help bring ideas to fruition.  

After working two years of 16-hour days on their own, Zach Dixon and his two partners took part in the Y Combinator program. “Being with a cohort of founders who were going through the same challenges was an amazing experience,” Dixon says. “It taught us to navigate personnel, fundraising and scaling issues. And it was a bit like college: the requirements were minimal, so it was up to participants to make the most of it.”  

“You become part of this amazingly prestigious accelerator program that educates you in any number of ways, optimizes you for fundraising — optimizes, really, your early company cohesion,” he says. After concluding the program, they raised a $2.5 million seed round from an impressive set of investors on favorable terms. One year later, the company had more than tripled its revenue and headcount.  

“There’s definitely our life before Y Combinator and our life after,” Dixon says.  

**3. Startup accelerators create an environment.**    

Whether virtual or in person, startup accelerators provide informal feedback and guidance on the technology or business concept you’re pursuing. These "hackerspaces" are collaborative workspaces where engineers and creative problem-solvers can help you pivot from an exhausted idea or break down a good idea and rebuild it into something even better. Many startup accelerators focus on specific types of businesses — consumer services, social media, healthcare technology — and amass high levels of expertise within their accelerator.  

**4. You gain access to physical space, and the camaraderie it provides.**    

While this wasn’t possible during the pandemic, more entrepreneurs are now taking advantage of open co-working spaces, offices, conference rooms, workbenches and other facilities. Not only is it nice to have the space, but you can also benefit from the emotional support that comes from being alongside other team members from different projects. Everyone is facing very similar challenges, and you can help one another by bouncing ideas around and engaging with CEOs and alumni.
