KPIs, or key performance indicators, are [[Metrics]] that measure the progress of a specific project toward your defined goals. KPIs need to be quantifiable and relevant, and should provide concrete evidence to [[Make Decisions]] going forward.
## What are KPIs?

KPIs are the units used to measure progress toward a particular goal. Effective KPIs follow the [[SMART]] Goals Framework, meaning that they’re Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound. KPIs are the measuring units you’ll use to check off the “M” in your SMART goal.
