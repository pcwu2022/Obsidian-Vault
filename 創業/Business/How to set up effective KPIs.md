Choosing the best KPIs for the job is a process with specific (but simple!) steps. Follow these four steps to get started.

### 1. Define your business objective

You can’t choose KPIs unless you know what you’re trying to measure. Start the process by defining your business [[objective]]. Make sure that your project is in alignment with the rest of your organization by consulting with company leaders and referring to other company-wide documents like your organization’s mission, overarching [[strategic plan]], and department-wide goals.

Depending on what level you’re working from—team manager, department head, director, VP, or company leader—you may be in a position to set both short-term and long-term KPIs. When planning at the executive level, you can set KPIs by the month, quarter, or year.

### 2. Identify important business [[Metrics]]

Once you’ve defined your business objective, you need to decide which [[Metrics]] are relevant to that objective. The [[Metrics]] you choose for your KPIs should be indicators that directly relate to whether or not you achieve your objective.

Remember: KPI stands for key performance indicators. There may be a variety of metrics or indicators that impact your ultimate goal. Creating the right KPI is about capturing the most important details and making sure you’re tracking those metrics. Not every task or project needs to have an associated KPI. 

If you’re not sure where to start, check out some relevant metrics for each department in your organization.

Example financial metrics

- Annual recurring revenue ([[ARR]])
- Net revenue [[Retention]] (NRR)
- Net profit margin (NPM)
- Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)
- Operating capital
- Cash flow

Example customer metrics

- Net promoter score (NPS)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT)
- Customer [[Retention]]
- Customer [[Churn]]    
- Number of total paying customers
- Number of new customers    

Example process and operations metrics

- Throughput time, or total lead time
- Number of complaint or bug tickets filed
- Supply chain metrics, like days sales outstanding (DSO)

Example people or human resources metrics

- Employee [[Retention]] rate
- Employee satisfaction
- Salary competitiveness ratio (SCR)

Example sales metrics

- Revenue growth
- [[Market]] penetration
- Customer lifetime value
- Gross profit margin

Example marketing metrics

- Number of qualified leads
- Lead conversion rate
- Social media followers 
- Content downloads
- Email click-through rate ([[CTR]])

### 3. Set up a tracking system

When you’re working on more than one project with more than one team, the number of KPIs you’re tracking can start to add up quickly. It’s important to have a tracking system in place that ensures your data is recorded consistently and at regular intervals. You won’t be able to draw accurate conclusions if you forgot to track some weeks or if you lost the data in a messy file folder.

A KPI dashboard is the best place to keep track of all of your KPIs. Having a central shared dashboard:

- Ensures everyone is looking at the same information
- Makes KPI data accessible to the entire team, no matter where they are
- Eliminates the need to manually notify [[Stakeholder]] every time something is updated
- Can track metrics automatically, so there’s no chance of forgetting
- Reduces the likelihood of human error

### 4. Track and share real-time progress

KPI data isn’t something you neglect until it’s time for your quarterly report. Rather, stakeholders should use KPI reports to make minor and major decisions throughout a project’s lifecycle. That’s why it’s important to keep your KPI data up to date and make it accessible to everyone at any time.

The best way to keep your data up to date is to use a dashboard that tracks and updates in real time. That way, stakeholders won’t need to wait until the next update to get the most recent information—they can just check the dashboard.

If you do track your KPIs manually, make sure you update at regular intervals that make sense for your project. For fast-moving projects, consider sharing updates weekly so everyone is tuned in to any changes. For longer-term, slower-moving projects, consider reporting biweekly or monthly to ensure each update includes enough information to be useful.

If possible, track and share progress in the same place you manage work so your team understands how their individual work contributes to the KPI and, as a result, to your broader company goals. At Asana, we use goal management software to connect our company goals to the work that supports them. With Goals, team members can prioritize projects to get their highest-impact work done.
