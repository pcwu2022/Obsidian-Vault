Maslow's Hierarchy of [[Needs]] is a motivational theory in [[psychology]] comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the needs are: physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.

## The Hierarchy

* **Physiological Needs:**
    * These are the most basic survival needs.
    * Examples: air, water, food, sleep, shelter, clothing, reproduction.
    * If these needs are not met, the body cannot function optimally.
* **Safety Needs:**
    * Once physiological needs are satisfied, the need for security becomes salient.
    * Examples: personal security, financial security, health and well-being, safety against accidents/illness and their adverse impacts.
* **Love and Belonging Needs:**
    * After physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, the third level of human needs is social and involves feelings of belonging.
    * Examples: friendship, intimacy, family, and a sense of connection.
* **Esteem Needs:**
    * These are the needs for respect and self-esteem.
    * Maslow classified esteem needs into two categories:
        * Esteem for oneself (dignity, achievement, mastery, independence)
        * The desire for reputation or respect from others (e.g., status, prestige).
* **Self-Actualization Needs:**
    * This is the highest level of Maslow's hierarchy, referring to the realization of a person's potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences.
    * It is the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be.

## Key Concepts

* **Deficiency Needs (D-needs):**
    * Physiological, safety, love, and esteem needs.
    * Arise due to deprivation.
    * Motivate people when unmet.
    * The longer these needs are unmet, the stronger the motivation becomes.
* **Growth Needs (B-needs):**
    * Self-actualization.
    * Do not stem from a lack of something, but rather from a desire to grow as a person.
* **Hierarchy:**
    * Needs are arranged in a hierarchy.
    * Lower-level needs must be met before higher-level needs can be addressed.
* **Progression:**
    * Individuals move up the hierarchy as lower-level needs are satisfied.
    * However, progression is not always linear. One can move back and forth between different levels of the pyramid.

## Criticisms

* **Lack of Empirical Support:** Research has not fully validated the hierarchical nature of the model.
* **Cultural Bias:** The hierarchy may not apply universally across all cultures.
* **Rigidity:** The model is criticized for being too rigid; needs do not always follow a strict hierarchy.
* **Definition of Self-Actualization:** The definition of self-actualization is vague and difficult to measure.

## Applications

* **Psychology:** Understanding human motivation.
* **Education:** Creating supportive learning environments.
* **Business:** Motivating employees and understanding [[consumer behavior]].
* **Healthcare:** Patient care and well-being.
